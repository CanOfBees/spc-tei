Washington 17 th Jany 1821 Dear Sir I have this day sent Talbot Jones two hundred dollars on your account one of which recieved from your. when coming home the other I want you to pay on money by me recieved here for James Tubb and Dillard I will give them an order on your. I will try to send some more money to Jones all I fear is that I shall be so harased on my return for money collected here as I was last spring and which compelled me to borrow money from Mr Tilestone that now takes all I can save to pay - I have not heard from you in some time.
