The note of Sittlejohn we cannot use now and probably not until spring unless at about ten percent. Do you wish us to sell it at a worse rate than 8%. We may be able to get it off at that rate but will have to wait for an opportunity. We cannot free it off any day. Your friends & Servts Perkins, Campbell & Co.
