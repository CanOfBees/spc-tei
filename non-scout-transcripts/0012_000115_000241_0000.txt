Warrenton Octr: 2nd 1832 Dear Burford Your letter of the 22nd Sept. Countermanding your order of the 19th same month was rcd: this morning, and agreeable to your instruction, I return you the check for $1200 - having made it payable to your order - It is impossible at this time to purchase such negros as you want at the price you authorised me in your last letter to pay - I will however keep you advised of the state of the market whenever a change worthy of notice occurs

I have resumed business in the small way, and will not undertake to enlarge it to any great extent until there is a change for the better in the market - negroes are generally lower in this country, in the latter part of the winter, thank at any other season of the year, and if you should determine to try the market at any future period, my services will at all time be at your command, and I would now retain your friends in anticipation of a favorable change in the puir of flures, but for fear of putting you to some inconvenience in the event of such a contengency not coming to pass in a resonable time- Your friend JMSaunders
