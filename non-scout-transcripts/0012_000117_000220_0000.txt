New Orleans April 21st 1855 Maj D. Burford Dear Sir, I am in recpt yours of the 14th inst. As soon as James comes to the city I will make an arrangement with him in regard to your drawing on him provided you wish to do so. I shall remain here until 1st of July and as James comes to the city but seldom (as he is trying to get along this year without an overseer) it would be best, if you find you will require the amount alluded to, to first write to me and I will get it from him and send it to you. In the mean time the first time he comes to the city I will make the arrangement for you to draw on him payable in the city at any time you may find it necessary. There is no necessity to renew the note on the mortgage nor is it even necessary to protest a mortgage note in this state. The prospect for crops - both of sugar & corn is very gloomy in this state. I have never known as dry a winter & spring. The money market is tightening daily. Remember me cordially to your family and believe me Very truly your friend Jos W. Allen
