March 1st 1864 Major Burford Dr sir Mothers health is verry feeble she is confined to the bed the most of the time she is verry low spirited and thinks she will not live verry long. I hope she is mistaken she is very anxious to see you she wishes to make a will. She has more confidence in you than any body else. She wishes you to come down as soon as you can. She wishes to talk and advise with you about the matter I hope you will come down if possible as it will afford her great satisfaction to see and talk to you she says if she had her wordly matters settled with your advice and counsil her mind would be verry much relieved. I have been suffering verry much with tooth ache & neuralgia for the last ten days I feel better this evening Your friend truly W.H. Hall
