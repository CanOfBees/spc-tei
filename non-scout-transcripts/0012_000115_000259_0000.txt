Alexandria Octr 29th 1829 My Dear Burford I arrived here yesterday with fourteen negroes, eight fellows two boys and four Women & girls all marketable except one women I bought for $75 in a settlement with my friend Roach I have my passage in sased and will probably depart tomorrow for N. Orleans. The price of the passage for each slave $17 and my own $30- fellows have cost me from $400 to $435 boys and girls in proportion all with certificates I have had the misfortune to loose our first rate fellow that ran off on the 13th of September and have never recd any certain account of him until I came here, I am now satisfied that he is still lurking in his former range in one of the adjoining Counties on the Virgina side of the Patomac, and have been informed that I can obtain $350 for him running

but it is out of my power to do any thing more at present than to constitute an agent to attend to the business which I have accordingly done with directions to ship him to me at N. Orleans as soon as he may be taken - in addition to this, I bought a fellow a few days since at $400, he was confused with another fellow which I purchased about the same time to a truse in a gentlemans yard, and in my absence to make some further trades in the same neighbourhood he got possession of an axe, and cut off all of the fingers of his right hand, a circumstance that no human forsight could have guarded against; my object at present is to dispose of the stock I have on hand and direct my attention to the collection of our claims in La. I have abandoned the idea of returning to this Country for the present Winters inttiss there should be some some favourable change in the markets - I have laid out all my

money and sold your man for $80 under the disadvantages of hard luck, I can - not flatter you with the prospect of making any thing on the trip, unless the runaway should be taken, then the purchase would afford a reasonable profit - your friend JM Saunders
