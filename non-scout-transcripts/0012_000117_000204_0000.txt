Washington City Feby 7th 1822 Dear Sir, On your return from New Orleans I want you to come by the way Tuscaloosa and spend a day or two there. It is but little turning out at Columbus. and may save me a ride of six hundred miles if there has been any thing saved out of that unfortunate wreck and in the hands of Thos Owen agent it is all important to me that it is got from him to meet debts that will be upon me for payment. I have sent to him Jack Worrels note also say thurns . whatever he has collected is in preference applicable to the discharge of these claims and he knowing the interest in these is vested in me by payment on my part. for worry note I have had to give my own note and to meet it I shall be at great difficulty without some thing from that establishment and certainly there must be something recieved. I am aware of the way agents in the place of Mr Owen turn every thing to their own advantage regardless who suffers so they can have the use of the money look you fully into that and satisfy yourself whether or not he is favouring the side of Jenkins so thus he has sued him on the notes as he promised to do and if anything can be brought out of Jenkins by giving him

time to pay with security give him as long as you please drovided the funds in owens hands is left to pay other claims and not applied to extinguish the debt Jenkins is sure for and promises to pay until other debts is first paid Several of which I have ready to place in the agents hands if it was worth while. If Jenkins thinks he can do better with the books and debts himself you may propose to him that the whole shall be given up to him and my interest entirely surrendered together with my capital of $2400 never to be claimed provided he gives satisfactory security for the debts owing at the disolution of partnerships if there is honor or honesty in him or his father I should think this proposal could not be refused and on the score of interest it ought to have their attention as it will be in their power in that way to be relieved from a business that will be ever hanging over John Jenkins and take his property if ever he pretends to own any however I have no hopes that you will be able to effect any thing you can only make the attempt which will them and the worst the usage I have secured at their hands, from owen get what you can and know the prospect of any thing here after Your friend Robert Allen
