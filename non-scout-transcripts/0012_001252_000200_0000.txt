Feb 2nd/1862 My Dear Sister. Three years with their changes, have passed since we met, or in any way communicated with each other, but do not imagine that I have not thought often of you for I remember with gratitude all you ever did for me & with pleasure I shall ever thing of the visit paid to you in your cheerful little home, but having heard that you were angry at me, I have never written, but Florida wrote me that you kindly remembered me, & desired that I should write to you, so I have seated myself to comply with the request, feeling some difficulty I must confess, in breaking a silience which has so long been mantained- I am staying at my little home alond - with the escaption of my little ones & servants - now that Mr leroy is in the army - the time has indeed been tedious, since he left & would have been unendurable with-out dear little Horace, who is talkative & sprightly & by his innocent prattle gave wings to many a wearly hour-. I would like to show my children to you, for I am partly moud of them - my babe is four weeks old, & is a fine girl, & sayed to be the prettiest child ever born in these parts - I have named her Lillie Belmont, the last name in memory of the battle & where her father fought so long & desperately against

such & overrwhelming force - & was at last captured & held a prisoner by the enemy for six days - Oh those were days of fearful suffering to me - Mr Leroy would have been released on Parole, if he had desired it, as he was a Regimental Officer, but he prefered to share the fate of his men & take the chances of an early discharge of prisoners. he fought bravely & gallantly, & was complimented by his leol & General for his coolness & daring - & even after he was captured - by inspecting the fortifications & observing the gun boats at leairo, he was enabled to give general Pillow , much useful information about the strength &c of the enemy- but I fear I shall weary you, praising my husband - for I can never tire bestowing just praise upone one who is so kind & affectionate & has rendered me so happy - but it smacks of Egotism & I will desist - I understand that John Alie Gordon is Captain of a company, at Felician about 12 miles from Columbus, Ky Duff Gordon is also at the same place, while Grecola Gordon uncle Dieks son is in a Regiment at Columbus - our family is well represented - brother Alphonse has a company at Columbus, brother John is liutenant in his company. We heard here of the battle of Hickory Creek & that Uncle Follieoffer had fallen I was shocked & distressed, to hear it & sympathise deeply with his children - we are represented as being badly whipped there, but the statements are so conflicting that we do not know what is correct & what is false. Our town is very dull now - so many of our citizens have gone to ware - that the place is almost depopulated-

our Country I am sorry to say is as strong for Union as east Tennessee & if the federals ever take Fort Henry we are ruined, for there are traitors from this very place - who have joined the enemy & in their wrath swear they will pilot them here to desolate our homes... Brother Alphonse's wife is in wretched health, I fear she will not live to welcome him back from the army - Pirss lenofs is married & has one child - she is living a fw miles in the country & Aunt Emily Johnson keeps house for Uncle Madin, Poca Fall is still living here, & although she has a pleasant home, & a kind husband, who gratifies every wish, she grumbles as much as cousin Fannie used to - she is well, & speaks of going home in March or April - if she does she will pay you a visit - Is dear little Fannie as smart and pretty as ever? I expect she has forgotten me - & little Eddie although have never seen him I love him, & hear him praised for smartness &c I have written more than I expected I hope you will reply. With love & best wishes to you & Mr Hicks not forgetting the little ones - I am yours Afet sister - Phoebe Cross
