Camp at Knoxville October 30, 1792 D Sir This Country is wholy involved in a War with the Creek & Cherokee Indians, I am not able to suggest the ocassion or the pretended cause of their depridations, the Sweep of the Northern tribes over our late unfortunate armies have created great exultation throughout the whole Southern tribes and the probability may be that they expect to be equally successful. The Spaniards is making use of all their are to draw over the Southern Tribes and I fear have Stimulated them to commence hostilities. Governor Blount has indefatigably laboured to keep those people in a specific humour all in vain. War is unavoidable, however ruinous and calamitous it may be in its apperations a better able well dirrected force. Speedily employed would Suppress and give a look to the hostile part of those Nations _ but, Should it be neglected for any lenth of time the whole will become warmly engaged _ and should that be the case the weight and burden of such an extensive and expensive war _ would in in my oppinion become, almost insupportable I have the pleasure of informing you that I have recovered my health and am with great regard __ D Sir Y Mo Ob S John Sevier Honble Mr Smith
