Committee of Lady Students Protest, June 1894

Page 2

[June 1894] Since we have heard from various sources that we the women students of the University are represented as desiring a motion to be placed in charge of our building we submit the following as an expression of our opinion:- 1. Such supervision is not necessary where there is no boarding department for women. 2. Women are not admitted to the University until they have attained an age when they are capable of conducting themselves properly. 3. We should consider it a reflection on our past behaviour should it be thought necessary to place a motion over us. 4. We think that the past year has shown that we are capable of governing ourselves without further help than that kindly given by the faculty and we think that body is of the same opinion. 5. We consider self reliance in matters of conduct as well as in study one of the chief advantages gained by a

university education and we believe that this benefit is best secured by the Woman's league and would be seriously impaired by the proposed form of government.
