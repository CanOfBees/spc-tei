Nashville December the 24th 1794 Sir G Enclosed is Morris Shanes Certificate &power with the Certificate of the Muster Master and his Captain on the back of the Old Certificate this will enable you to report to the war office in favor of the poor man who stands security for the money. Before I got home I was met with the News of the Murder of Colo Montgomery and two others the latter of whome have till lately lived in a peaceble part of the Country Since that three of my neighbors all verry respectable citizens have been Killed but a small distace from the Settlement, This shews how little dependance is to be put in Treaties and also proves how much we are neglected for want of protection for all the Troops allowed to this district is not sufficient to guard one County as it ought to be done for when mischief is done in one part of the district the troops are so scattered the enemy will be entirely out of reach before they can possibly collect and if there was none at all in service it would be better than so few as every one would then have an equal right to win out I hope you will not forget the red Ink powder as poke berrys are all dead, and believe me I am Sir with Esteem you obdt servt S. Williams
