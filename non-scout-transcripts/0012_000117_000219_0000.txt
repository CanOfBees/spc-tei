New Orleans April 2 nd 1855 Maj. D Burford, Dear Sir, My brother James is in the City and requests me to ask you if you will wars your money at the maturity of the note. He says if it would suit you as well he would like to keep it longer. He also desires me to say that in case you are willing for him to keep it he will pay the interest or not as you prefer in advance or at the expiration of another year. Please write me on the Subject. The money market has become easier than during Jany & Feby. Capitalists are however extremely choice in signatures. I apprehend more trouble in Commercial Circles before the close of the season. I have heard nothing from David Druce 1st Feby he was then in fine health very strong and promises to be an altered man. Remember me to Mis B and Mary Your friend most truly Jos W. Allen Direct letters for one to Box A No 18 New Orleans
