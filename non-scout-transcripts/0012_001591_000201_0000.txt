Dr Uncle, I told Andrew that I would see Wm on the subject of the road this evening, but it was an hour in the night before I could get through the delivery of my pork to Mr. Smith + others. So that I must put it off till tomorrow. Mr Fletcher would have risked the trial of the road case, but Mr Ward thru Mr. Washington asked + obtained a continuance. Mr Fletcher acquiesced under a hope that it could be compromised, and believing that almost any compromise would be preferable to the failure of the application for damages, a result which was almost certin had the trial been had yesterday. I discover that the copy referred to by Mr. Fletcher corresponds with the original agreement respecting the route for the road: and, although it may not be a valid paper in law for the want of the signiature of all the parties, still it strengthens the opposition made to a claim for damage by the party agreeing to it. The road can be stopped, possibly, by Mrs Ward because she did not sign the agreement, but I trust the agreement suggested by Andrew + William Donelson will be adopted by all the parties and thus all controversy be amicably settled before the meeting of the next court. I will come over as soon as I get

my breakfast and make out as nearly as I can the statement you desire. I do not see however of what avail my statement may be in the explanation of the agreement. I acted on first the Jury of damage and voted to allow Mrs Ward damage to the amount of $200. I was not with the other jury. Yrs affectionately A J Donelson. Jany 2d 1844 Genl Andrew Jackson
