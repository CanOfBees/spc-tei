Col. Crozier will please ascertain Col. B & s figures - be as specific as you can about these figures & at as early a period as possible. If they are tangible & admissable how would it do for me (bitter as the pill is) to write at once to Washington & know the worst at once. Until the practicability of the dismisal of the suit is known I see no use in a compromise of the other suits which is offered me on good terms. If proof in MKnitts case is to be taken who should be appointed to take it both in Tenn. & N. Carolina
