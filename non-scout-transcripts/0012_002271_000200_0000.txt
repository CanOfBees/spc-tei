Misses Polly Carpenter & Nancy Sweet Elliot Choctaw Nation ________March 7th 1822 My Dear Sisters, The transactions of this evening remind me of what I once enjoyed with you when I was permitted to walk with you to the house of God___ and to unite with you in prayer and praise around the Mercy Seat __ When reflecting upon those interesting and pleasant seasons, I cannot express to you the consolation it affords to hope with a confident assurance that I am still remembered __ and though seperated by hundreds of miles, we still approach the same Throne of Grace, the same God is present with each of us _ _ and it is not a consolation that this separation is short __ that soon our prayers will end, and we shall join in songs of praise around the Throne of God and the Lamb and go no more out FOREVER __ I sometimes feel that this is very near, a few more rolling suns __ and I shall be where Jesus is __ shall see God face to face __ shall rejoice in his presence, and eternally feast on his unchangeable love __ With these prophets in view, and forgetting what is around me __ I long to quit this clayey tabernacle and sit down in my Heavenly Fathers Kingdom ___ Yet would I wait His time, and untill He is pleased to call me hence, can desire no greater sum of happiness, and no other employment than his service ___ But I spoke of what has passed this evening ___ My Sisters have just been in my room and spent a season in prayer ___ Some poor Choctaw women were here, to whom we endeavoured to make known the words of Eternal Life; they listened with attention ___ Such seasons are peculiarly solemn and interesting; and here, they are frequent Almost daily, do some of these ignorant people come to our habitations " to hear, " as they say, " about good thing " ___So you remember the spring and summer of 1820 So you know what it was to live in anxious suspense many weeks___ to hope, and pray, and wait with longing desires to see the Salvation of God, then you may know something of our present situation at Elliot___Although the blessing is yet withheld, still would we hope in God ___ These souls will yet be given to Christ for his inheritance, for he has purchased them with his own blood __ He will yet see of the travail of his soul here and be satisfied __ How soon this glorious event will take place, He only knows; but the precious cloud of mercy which has long appeared to hang over us, and which has shed a few refreshing drops, we trust, has not yet passed away: but hope, and believe, we may yet receive such a shower of Grace The following text was written down the left margin of this page. Remember me affectionately to your dear Parents, Mothers and Sisters___ Ask your Mothers if they have not given you to the Lord ___ The preceding text was written down the left margin of this page.

as shall not only gladden our hearts, and cause this desert to bud and blossom like the Rose: but shall rejoice the hearts of God's children in Christianland and occasion joy in heaven among the Angels of God One of the members of our school, we hope, is a child of God __ Conversing with him this evening, he said, " It is so good to pray; I used to forget it; but now I can't help think of it " __ Little more than two years since, this Boy came the distance of 100 miles to be received into this school __ Then, a wild Choctaw Now, a lamb of the Saviour's Flock ___ Soon, may I be permitted to tell you of more of the wonderful works of God here My Sisters, we want more laborers here, and those too, who have Holy hearts The influence of unholy example upon our children will be felt in eternity At present, hired laborers must be employed here, at least, until more of God's children will come and strengthen us, and the property of the Lord must be paid to those, whose hearts are not in the work ___ Nancy, have you not once given yourself to this work? Have you not been ready to say, Lord, here am I, send me? have you not even consecrated yourself to the service of Christ in a heathen land? and now, will you take back, what you have given to the Lord? Are you doing more for God in your present situation, in your present employment, than you could in any other? Do you indeed feel, that you are laboring for Christ, and in that way, which will bring most Glory to his name And do you daily grow in Grace, and get nearer to the Saviour? If so, go on, and the Lord strengthen and bless you___ I trust this is the case; or you would not be willing to remain where you are___ Polly, How is it with you? Are you doing much for Christ? much for the salvation of perishing souls? It is good to spend and be spent for Christ: and good to be where we can do most for him.__I do not ask you to come to Elliot, although I should rejoice to see you ___ I only ask you to enquire, " Lord what wilt thou have me to do? " Perhaps you have, and your duty is already made plain __ if so, you are happy in the assurance that God will be with you If not, perhaps a greater work is assigned you, than you are aware ___ and it may be among the Savages of the wilderness __ Now, seriously consider the wretched condition of these souls; look at what is around you, remembering at the same time the words of our blessed Saviour, how he said, " It is more blessed to give than to receive; " and " He that watereth shall be watered also himself," and then leave it with God to decide__ The following text was written down the left margin of this page. So My Dear Girls, write___ I think, you promised it__ And pray much for me __ Shall I remind you of our monday evening Concert? Probably you remember it The preceding text was written down the left margin of this page.

You cannot know how much so; for it is impossible for me to express it with a pen __ I only say, I would not exchange my situation for any below that rest, which I hope, through Grace to enjoy in the Kingdom of our Father __ But Oh! could I hear, my dear daughter enquiring "What shall I do to be saved" __ could I see them turning to the Lord and becoming his disciples then, with joy, could I The following text was written down the left margin of this page.

"How tellest thou thy servant depart in peace __ for mine eyes have seen thy salvation!" __I have nothing of this to encourage me except the promises of God, which are sufficient __ Although, many of them appear seriously disposed, listen with attention to what is said, and often tell me that they pray to God__ It comforts me to think, that the friends of Zion pray for them and though God may not bless my unworthy labors, and hear my feeble petitions, the blessings may descend in answer to the prayers of his children in Christian Lands And now my Sisters, I must leave you__the thought of it is painful, for when writing, I feel as if I were conversing with you___ May the blessing of our Almighty Saviour rest upon you and may he enable you to serve him faith- fully even until death and then, if we meet no more on earth, Oh may we meet in that happy world, where we shall sing, and talk, and love, and praise, and thus spend a long eternity Your affectionate Sister Hannah Thatcher
