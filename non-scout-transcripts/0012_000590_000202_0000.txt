Copy Washington City July 4th 1836 Sir Bifise I left the Cherokee Country; and after the Cherokee Treaty was concluded. Knowing the very disturbed condition of the Cherokees and their suffering need of provisions I requested some persons whom I knew were able to do it, to supply the poor and destitute with provisions to keep them from starvation. I requested particularly Col A. R. L. Hunter of Huntington Wa & Mr. Rogers the father of Wm Rogers, one of the Cherokee delegation from the Chattahoochee in georgia; and Mr. Wm H Thomas, of Haywood NC to render the Indians in their vicinity every repary aide assistance; and i assumed then they would be paid by the government a fare price for the same out of the money provided for this purpose by the 18th article of the treaty. I trust therefor that the government will give the necessary directions and instructions to their agents entrusted with this leurinz to allow and pay the accounts of these gentle men for the provisions they have furnished according to my request, and at such a price as the other contracts are made for Cenn. I am with great respect Your Abl Seral John F. Schummaker (signed) To the Honorable Elbert Herring Commissioner LA I certify that the above is a true copy from the original on file in the Office Indian Affairs 22 May 1839 L. R. Cruttenden LR
