Knoxville. Oct. 18th. 1863 My dear Washburn, Two weeks ago tonight, you left us at Cincinnati - I hope you reached your destination in safety & comfort - We thought of you & spoke of you, every day, as having arrived at different points in your journey. We left on Tuesday as we intended. We crossed the Ohio, to Covington, at L. Pell & wen Joor Whirling the one way to Lexington. At Nicholasville, we arrived at S Pill in a disagreable rain. This is the tirmiuus of the R. Road, & from there we came the cutin distance to Knoxville, in Gov't Ambulances. Mr. & Mrs Tachustock & Pleas. meet us at Nicholasville & came on with us. OUr drivers were soldiers who took this means

of coming to Knoxville to join their regiments. We had a long tedious journey, on the roughest road I ever saw. We passed the famous Wild Cat battle - field - the wildest spot you can imagine - & saw the place where your borther's tent was pitched - & where the rebel Perry Newman & Athens were slain. At our place, a small rock is placed underish in the ground, with the inscription "3 Lecesh buried here," cut upon it with a knife. & from this defeat you know the rebels turned back to Knoxville, & then went on to Somerset to get a terrible whipping at Mill Spring - We came to Barbourville & then to cumberland Gap - This is a wonderful place & when you come home, I hope you will see it. We spent a night at Tazewell & another at Maynardville, & then after a few hours' ride, we were in Knoxville. It rained hard, & the

streets were very muddy, & we were taken by our caudley escort (a pack of Molford's) through Gay St. as far as Cumberland St. & thenee to Mr. Brownlow's while there waiting to unload I received an invitation through one Beu to go to Mr. Diekeiuson Accordingly, I came here where I am now writing. Tho' how long I may stay I do not know. Our house is occupied by a Federal Officer Gen Gilbert & is in a wretched condition - I have not been to look at it. Your father has been all through it. Aunt Nold , Ben & Caroline are all here, & welcomed us most joyfully. Aunt Nold wants to see you & Jimmy - The says the watered your garden last year, after we left & sold your crop, & you are entitled now, to & 5,00 Confederate money - As we were journeying witheeward we met Perez Cowan, who grab oz-

hard, onhis way to Amherst College - I told him if he had been out a few days earlier he would have met you at cincinnati & you could have gone to N. York together. I am truly rejoiced that he has gone there. He will write you I think - I have not seen Mat. yet. I cannot tell you much about the state of things here at present. Gen. Burnside is here & I have seen him & like him. Your brother I have not seen but I hope he will get a furlough of at least four or five days & come & see me. I have nothing more of your cousin Wen I only hope he will, someday make his appearance among us. Your sister is not quitting just yet that she is at home - It does not seem just like the old place to her. She is well & wants to see her brother. Your father is still here, with me & my will, & like me he wants to hear from you. Write to me darling, as soon as you receive this & let us know all about you & your Academy. May God love & bless you Your Mother Most affecty
