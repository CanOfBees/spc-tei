Guild Sir - I demand of you a copy of all and every letter which I have written you since Judge White has consented for his name to be reen for the Presidency of the U.

Respectfully D. Burford N.B. This will be handed you by my friend Wm Richard Hall through whom you can convey and any reply which you may choose to make me in writing. you may also show this to Maj. Trousdale D.Burford
