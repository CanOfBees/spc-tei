Flag Ship Hartford Off new Orleans Feb. 22. 1863 Sir: I cannot permit an officer who has served so long and so faithfully under my command to leave without a line from me, expressive of my feelings of respect and admiration for his high qualities as an officer. Twelve long months have you zealously, diligently, and faitfully, Blockaded the Port of Mobile, sometimes with only one and sometimes with no vessel to assist you; and yet have never heard the first complaint or murmur from you - The duty was performed always to the best of your ability, and no one could have done it better - this in my opinion is the highest praise I can bestow upon an officer - I will add that I regret to lose your service, and will always be happy to have you under my command. Respectfully Your Obedt Serv't D.G. Farragut Rear Admiral To Commander J.C. Febiger U.S.N.
