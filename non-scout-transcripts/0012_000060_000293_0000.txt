Savannah Ga. Oct. 24. 1850. My Dear Wife I arrived here safely last night & have found comfortable quarters in the Pulaski House from where I now write you. I have already become known to several warm-hearted Georgians who will be of service to me in the way of business & help to while off the time that intervenes between this & the arrival of the ship containing our iron. How long that will be is impossible to tell. I have just telegraphed to New-York to hear when the ship left & will hear in a few hours - but perhaps not in time to write you after it arrives. Here, they say, it may be be from contrary winds 10 or 15 days behind time. Still she may come in to night. I hope how soon. It is too early for me to hear how the little girls have got. But to morrow or next day at furthest I will expect to receive letters. It is very warm here. If I had my summer clothes I would certainly put them on. It is like our September, but they have had frost once & they say it is healthy except the brake bone fever which has nearly run out of cases. I hope not to take it. It is more troublesome than dangerous.

I wrote you from Atlanta & gave you all the directions I could think of about business matters for Robert McKnitt & Crozier. They must all do the best they can in my absence long or shorter. I will be home that moment business allows me. I have been North & South East & West & there certainly is no place equal in all respects to East Tennessee & especially Mecklenburg. I am sure of that. Are you well yourself & the rest at home. If I knew that I could hear from our absent children I could while off my stay here better. Love to all from Your Affectionate J.G.M. Ramsey
