Washington 11 June 1813 Dear Sir When I wrote you the other day, respecting the action between The Frigates Chesapeake and Shannon, I did, from the news thus circulating fully believe that our Vessel had proved Victorious _ It seems to be generally believed, and I fear with too much certainty that the Chesapeake has been taken _ It appears that in the commencement of the action the British ship was very much injured in a very short time, having several masts shot away, which inclined the Chesapeake to bear down in order to board, and just in the act of so doing so, there was a large Quantity of combustible matter thrown on board from the English Ship, seting great part of our vessel in a compleat flame, which is thought to be the cause of her immediate striking __ It is said, and generally believed, that there was some infernal machine thrown, of an entire distructive nature, but what the damage have been, we are not yet informed__ General Dearborne has taken Fort George, Queenstown, and Fort Erie, with little loss, and was in pursuit of the enemy who were endeavouring to make their retreat down to

to the lower Canaday __ Our fleet on The lakes under Commodore Channecy, appear to be Overruning The British in every opportunity they have when coming into contact with the enemy _ I believe the British only posess one Garrison in U. Canady, (Malden) and it is very probable, that The American Flag is now flying at that place. __ We are progressing very slowly ___ Remember me affectionately to our friends__ I am entirely sick at being so long from home, and believe if I was onr more there, I should never return __ I had like to have forgot to mention, that Cozen Alex Sevier have had a duel with one of your Captains _ A, received a shot through his arm, his adversary one in the breast, but thought not to be mortal __ Your affectionate Friend John Sevier Col. Sevier
