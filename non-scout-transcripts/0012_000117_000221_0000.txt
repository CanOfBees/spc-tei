New Orleans March 27th 1856 Major David Burford Dear Sir, I enclose herein my checks on the Bank Tennessee at Nashville in your favor viz No 2048 $5000: No 2049 $6000: No 2050 $6406 payable without grace respectively 1st May 15th May and 1st June next. Together amounting to Seventeen thousand four hundred and six dollars investment of money received this day from Louis Bush Adm. of the estate of James G. Allen as per statement herewith. I considered this the best investment I could make for you and hope you will be pleased with it. I have never had more solicitude about any debt than this owing to the fact of your having entrusted so large an amount to me to employ for you and I am much gratified in being able to return it to you without expense or delay. I had to agree to wait another year for my own money to enable Mr Bush to pay yours. Should you need any or all of the money before the checks mature the Bank will discount the checks for you @ 6% premium. I have allowed you that difference between the discounting on sight checks; 3/4% dis't being the rate for my sight checks. Please enclose me the recpt I gave you for the money when you handed it to me at Nashville. Your friend Jos W. Allen
