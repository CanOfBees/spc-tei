that his uncle intended to intercept the passage of the vessel somewhere below New Orleans and take the negroes across the lake to the high lands in Missippi to avoid the pestilence which has been more fatal in the south than any other section of the continent. - tho I am gratiful to see by this mornings paper that the disease had on the 19th of Nov entirely subsided in New Orleans - the Vets and the Cholera will pay the dues with the negro traders this year - you will vubtly be compelled to listen to a great many (and among them no small portion) exagerated accounts of the maligrity and fatality of this awful epedinie; which is to be sure at best bad enough; but with W. Franklins experiences prudence and management, together with
