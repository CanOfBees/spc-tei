Boston. March 31. 1851. W.P. Tifft Esq Dear Sir We have you Inv. and Bill Lading of two passenger cars and fixtures shipped to your care for a/c East Tennesse & Georgia Railway Co. c/o Bryit Dunbar. They are insured. We were obliged to agree to put the Cars on and take them off the vessels deck at the expense of the road, or lose the opportunity of sending them. With jacksaws, and such apparatus as any rigger can provide the cards can be easily handled. They are in fine order now and well stowed. It is important for us that you should write to Miss AD Keyes & MB Pritchard & Dr. Ramsay that the cars are landed & according to Invoice and Bill Lading, as soon as the same are landed and found to conform to Inv. We shall probably ship a Locomotive tomorrow 1st April we have not yet the name of the vessel engaged to convey it. We are dear Yours truly Fullerton & Raymond
