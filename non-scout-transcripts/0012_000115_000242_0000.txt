Page 2

Philad. Feby 20 1838 Major D. Burford Sir, Inclosed please find Thos Phelp's note for $169.64 which I have forwarded to your care at the suggestion of his letter of the 4th inst. wherein he says "he will pay one half of it with good cash Notes or Cash" on condition of recurring a release for the other half. I presume of course he includes the interest which is over two years - I consider it rather a hard case for me, after waiting patiently so long to receive only one half the debt - ( for I dont see how I can recover from Taylor) but I suppose the best I can do will be to accept Mr. Phelps' offer; please acknowledge the receipt of this, & let me know when the business is arranged Respectfully Yours Sam Hildeburn Kims Enlells Collected the whole note and interest 15th March 1838 amounting to $183.44 D. Burford wrote the above date. sent by Mr Jones 27Apl38
