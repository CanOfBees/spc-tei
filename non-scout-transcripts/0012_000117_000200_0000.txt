Washington March 12th 1820 Dear Sir I have just recieved your letter of the 23d All , in which you notice my remarks on James Allens note I have no Idea that you want in any way intentionaly give me uneasiness and may have my self to blame perhaps for not being more explicit I might have said the way I expected pay from him wanted him to take his note and sell it but I intended to reserve to my self the time of doing so as I cannot bring my mind to that of distressing him and the case of James Reed is an other which gives me great Pain because he was with me Just before I started and drew from a promise to have word to apist him in dificulty in my absence instead
