Hd. Qrs. 2d Div. 23d Army Corps Hodges, Tenn, Sept. 17 1863- Dear Father On the evening of the 14th Genl. White received orders to move his Division at once to Knoxville & from there to Greenville. We broke camp at 3 o'clock on the 15th marching 25 miles or within 5 miles of Knoxville—yesterday we made 15 miles & started this A. M. at 4 o'clock for a long push when orders reached Genl. W at this place causing a halt until farther orders. This place is near Strawberry Plains, on the R. R.- This sudden move was made on account of the appearance of a rebel force in the Eastern part of the State. The Div. was hard at work at Loudon running a flour mill, building a pontoon bridge &c and expected to move Southward if any way when all of a sudden we receive to move this way—there it is in the Army you cannot tell what an hour will bring forth. The soldier soon cares little where or when he goes. Genl's Burnside and Hartsuff took up Hd. Qrs. in rebel mansions. I took tea with Genl White at Genl. Hartsuffs Hd Qrs. The furniture at his qrs. is elegant everything was left but the Genl. had the carpets taken upo. Knoxville is a very

pleasant place but has the same rusty appearance tha all Southern places have—the scenery around is very picturesque. There are many fine residences in and around the city. The country is very fine in this part of the state & crops abundant.
