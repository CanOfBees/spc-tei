Henry Warren Srgt Mayor of the 9th Tenn Cavalry & myself at your side when we were nearly abreast of a hill thickly covered with timber we were fired upon by a forty of men who had concealed timberlines then we immediately rallid & some of our men were about to fire when you commanded them not to do as as you insisted they were our own men. about twenty of us found them as you were hiltn mounted then altun altun you was able to keep in advance we fussed the guerillas closely & Pride was forced to quit his horse & endeavored to escape in first you ordered him to surrender which he did & you funnled one or two men from shooting at him by hitting them till he had surrendered

His brother who was Gene Willams orderly stated publicly that you was justifiable & acted on the hardest principal of self defense you will probably remember that Capt James Bald was shot by a Rebel Soldier at Morristown after he (the Rebel) had surrendered The forty that fired on us did us in a dastardly & cowardly manner were guerillas & bush whackers & not enlisted to the wrongs of civilizezd maybe they had allowed two full companies of our troops to pass them & evidently desired to pick off some of our officers Yours Truly W Bayless Lots Adj. 9 th Ten Com
