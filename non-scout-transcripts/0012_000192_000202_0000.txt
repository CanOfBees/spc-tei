Hd. Qrs. 1st Div. Cav. Corps Rockford Tenn. Nov. 11. 1863. Dear Father I send you herewith, a copy of a letter recd. this evening from Brig. Genl. White at present near Loudon. If you can make any use of it in furthering my appointment please do so. I shall not forward the original, at present, so if you can use the original to better advantage and will please inform me at once I will send it to you. Mother's letter of the 2nd of Nov. came to hand this evening and i was right glad to get it. It shall receive dut attention soon. There is nothing of importance since writing you day before yesterday. I am liking my new position very well. It is a busy one but congenial to my wishes. Tell mother I am glad to hear that I am remembered in your prayers. My hope in Christ and trust in His salvation is as strong as ever. But there is but little opportunity to grow as a Christian, in the Army. With much love. Your ever dutiful son Watson.
