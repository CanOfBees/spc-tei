Maj D. Burford, Dixons Spring Smith County Tennessee From Jos W. Allen Private

Page 2

Confidential Maj D Burford My Dear Sir Col Johnson wrote me a few weeks ago that he wished to quit the Bank of Tennessee and wanted me to accept the Presidency. I replied to him that I could not do so, he requested me to suggest someone. I have not done so as yet, but wish to place your name before him if you will consent, and I shall await your answer before saying anything to him on the subject. You intimated when I saw you last that you would like to move to Nashville - with a good cashier, you would have an easy time of it in the Bank and could retain it as long as you wished. Please consider this strictly private. My family are all well. Remember me to yours. Your friend truly Jos W. Allen
