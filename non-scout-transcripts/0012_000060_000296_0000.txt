your grief and the sorrow of your afflicted family. May Heaven, smile upon those who remain, and protect them and you through a long and prosperous life.

Though others may grow up around you he will ever be missed from the circle. There is no consolation for the father, except that high faith in Him who guides and directs all for a grander and happier existence where grief, & care shall abide no more. With every wish for your health and that of your family. I am Dear Doctor Yours Sincerely & Cordially Curtis B. Raymond
