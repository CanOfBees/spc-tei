Nashville Aug 18 18 1841 DBurford Enj D. Sir, You have learned before this that I arrived here a few days ago. It was my intention to visit you as soon as I got up in order to fill an appointment made with Johnston & to arrange the terms of compromise between the him and yourself. But visiting with Col Guild & having a consultation in reference to all the matters in controversy, he stated that he was in suspicion of my visit, concurred in them & would see you at Your Court. That it was therefore unnecessary for me to go up. If there be any this further that you wish to comminicate, write early as I shall leave as soon after the 10th such as possible. I learn from my Brother lrlow that a letter was recd. from you after I left home. He expected that I would see you & did not speak of the contents of the letter Truly Yr. friend T J Wharton
