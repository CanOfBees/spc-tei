Huntersville NC June 5th 1890 Mrs E.A.R Breck Knoxville Tenn Dear Madam: At the request of your Brother Mr R M Ramsey I write you this note. I am pained to state that he will not remain long with us as I think he is near his last. I have attended him faithfully for the past 12 weeks, and he has asked me to write you and thank you for your favors, as it has added so much to his comfort and assisted me very much in treating his case skillfully. I do not see how I could have kept him up for so long without your assistance

as I would have had the whole burden to carry which you know would have entailed a heavy expense upon me on account of this circumstance. But Mrs Breck there has not been any thing madam that could have been done and any comfort has been at his hand. I have never attended a patient that I felt such a deep interest in, as he had a large family almost helpless and which was dependent upon him for a support. I will close Yours truly M.C. Kuretes, M.D.
