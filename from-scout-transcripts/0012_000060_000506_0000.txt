Sonnet. To my honored and beloved Friend, Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey January 1. 1883. O, dearly loved and venerable friend, Thank God Thou livest still and dost behold One more New Year, which gathered to the fold Of the past ages that which late did end! When future faithful annalist hath penned Impartial record, Thou shalt stand enrolled With sages and historians famed of old, And as Thy native land's most thoughtful friend. O may the God of Might preserve thee still To see the coming Eighteen eighty four And so many more, till centenarian fame Shall bliss thee too; and thy glad friends whose will Thy Truest welfore seeks, shall ope Thy door In joy as now, our blessings to proclaim! W.G. McAdoo Knoxville, Tennessee.
