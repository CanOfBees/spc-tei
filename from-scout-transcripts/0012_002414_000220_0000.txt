Dear John I have read your letter of yesterdays date and am sorry to see that any one who pretends to be acquainted with the affairs of the Bank should make statements so entirely destitute of truth. I have shown your letter to Mr King who was instructed by the committee of merchants (of whom I was one) to transmit to Mr Biddle their joint letter and in doing so to state distinctly that it was their wish and intention to publish the correspondence and he would frame his copy accordingly _ In the receipt of Mr Biddles reply which was not as pointed on some points as was desirable, Mr King &Mr. Stevens met Mr Biddle on his arrival at the Boat on the following day and again stated to him their intention to publish the correspondence if on consulting the committee it should be thought expedient. It was the intention of all parties from the first that it should be published &So distinctly understood. This statement will enable you to correct the misstatement made at the North American Insurance office, but should hardly think it necessary to take any further notice of is Politicians now a days asses whatever they may think will answer their ends, without being as much if any poany to ascertain
