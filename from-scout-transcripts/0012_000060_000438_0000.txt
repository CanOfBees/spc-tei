To my Family & Friends I wish to be buried directly Past of my mothers grave on the side of my fathers tomb as indicated by the inscription upon one of its side panels -- I desire a very modest & inexpensive Funeral -- The services to be held in the House & then in the old Lebanon-in-The-Fork-Church. Mrs. R. or MKnitt -- or both may or may not qualify to act under my Will. My own opinion is that there is no absolute necessity for either of them to do so. But I may not be right. J.G.M. Ramsey. Mecklenburg Place May 20. 1877
