Knoxville Ten Sept 17/63 My Very Dear Wife A long time occored sine I wrote you my last nor have I in that time which has been more than six weeks, have I had your kind cheerful letters nevertheless your dear Husband has been well very well cheerful contented and happy though our march over the mountains was somewhat severe still it was pleasant and cheerfully performed then again we were placed on half rations except coffee, and a very needful beverage it was to, yet, amidst all the privations and hardship we passed through still we have lacked "no good thing" and have got over into East Ten without the loss of a man or the fireing of a gun. much to the joy of a persecuted brutally used hunted down, and truly Loyal people and whose enthusiasm was unbounded almost frantically so. as the sight of The Yankees as they invariably call up such manifestations of joy I never saw in all my life we were greeted amidst the waving of the old stars and stripes of hankerchiefs the throwing up of hats and and one continued long cheering of shout after shout and the quick grasp of the hand. nor have I amidst all this forgotten to the great source from whence every blessing doth eminate and evry day I tried to look to that great source our kind heavenly Father, nor have I been alltogether without good christian counsell even in this land of persecution
