Knoxville Sept. 30/65 Jno. Bracklesby Esq. Hartford Ct. Dear Sir - Absence from home, has prevented an earlier reply to your letter in relation to the note you hold vs WC Kain. His property here is involved in litigation so that I am unable to see how you could do anything to accomplish your purpose, and in an interview with him today he suggested it would be best to postpone any action for the present. Some time since I recd a letter from Cousin May, your good Lady, which I designed to have answered promptly, but mislaid her letter, and must crave her pardon for the seeming neglect - and plead the business mans ready excuse, press of business &c. Claibourn is still healthy cheerful & hopeful and I think anxious for the day of trial. He has not yet recd the argument expected from Mr Curtis and is getting anxious about it. I have written to him to day, and perhaps it would

be well for you to write him also. The temper of this community I think has improved materially recently - and I observe a more moderate tone in the last 2 mos. of the Knoxville Whig also. I understand Judge Hall sent a man to the Penitentiary this week from an adjoining County for 6 years for intimidating and takeing from one of his neighbours 2 sides of Bacon, and in his charge stated to the jury, that a rebel stood before the law the same as a Union man, and that there was no law that allowed one citizen to rob another because of his political opinions - this of course has always been the law, but the other has been the practice recently. But the charge is regarded as very favourable to order as against the mob. I have made my arrangements to remove my family & business to Atlanta Geo. and expect to do so by the 1st Nov. next. With love to all. Hastily yours Jos. L King
