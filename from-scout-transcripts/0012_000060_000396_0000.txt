Madison, Wis, Apl. 2d 1871 My Dear Dr. Ramsey - I ought to have acknoledged yr. kind favor some time since. I doubt pour wht. you wrote me if this finds you at Charloote - if not, I hope it will follow you, if only to showyou that I do not forget you. I sent an excellent serren in pamphlet form, before our society, by Judge Walker, of Detroit - about as good a specimen of our Northern Christian Democratic scholars & jurists as you will find. If it failed to reach you, let me know, & I will try again.

I dont get off on my journy yet - I do not see that I can till the 20th or later - so much to do. I am not at all certain that I shall go by way of Knoxville - itis so out of the way for the route I have marked out. A few of the descendants of Ms. Sumpter (as they spell their name) are yet in Knox Co- Tenne. - one of the old man's daughters is the wife of Capt. Jack Anderson - the rest fo the clan remaining reside some 12 ms north - Baylers Marten & Cline : So Kearn form Ees: M. White- & fear form wht. I learn that they know too little of their early family history to make it worth the while to go there. Do drop me a line that I may hear from you before my departure - so as to know if you are still at Charlotte - if so, how long you intend to remain May God & the good guardian angels hover around, protect & bless you & yours! Faithfully Feine LymanC. Draper. I am doing well with my historical correspondence. Even Dr. Logan, of Alabama, has broken silence, & writes me kind frieanly letters.-
