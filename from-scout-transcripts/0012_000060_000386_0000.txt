Our Retreat March 30, 1870 Dear Sir I wrote you yesterday in full but the one who took it to Salisbury forgot to put a stamp upon it I dropped it into the P.O. Box with several other letters & thus it may never reach you & therefore hasten to repeat what I wrote you yesterday viz that I have already seen ymcoon, Burton Craige formerly M.C. from this Dist. Attorneys at Law Washington that as every day they had access to Dockit of Supreme Court U.S. he requested them to examine & send him word when the case of Ramsey against Ludlow would be taken up to answer him at once. I hope he will hear from them soon & I will immediately forward to you. But you had better write to the Clerk there & find out certain by & at once. Who will represent the case any how? I have left it all in your hands & if you do not go can you deputise & employ another who has all the points & will be faithful? It is a critical point & I know you will be vigilant If the Clerk fails to answer your letter &if Col Craige fails to hear from Pike &(with the former of whom he missed two years in Congress) is there

Page 2

not some other lawyer friend of yours (-say from Nashville) now in Washington to whom you can write? It would be unfortunate if after all your trouble & my expense the case comes on abruptly & we suffer a snap judgment If the Com. (Comfort) is unable to make a report at the next town in the B. & R. case, you say "I will have a breathing spell to dispose of any property I have there. " Will let us use it at once. I wrote you heretofore & asked you how it would do for me to confess judgment in Mrs. Swans favor & to nin the levy upon Walleys house & lot 3 I hope to be able to redeem it hereafter. But hers is an honest debt & you must be sure & make it sure to her When Mrs. Breck returned to our house a widow I borrowed the money she brought back I had before the war paid her back seven K.C. Bonds on that account I still owe her 6 or 8 hundred dollars. During the war I could not pay her anything & since the surrender my impeainiosity continued till the arrival of your last remittance when I paid her $100.00. Now this is as just a debt as H. W.s & I wish you therefore to act as Mrs. W. Attorney & confess judgment for me in both cases & pay them off in full out of my house & lot. That is all the ealty unincumbered that I won & very little personally only so far as my notes from

Page 3

Breakbill & Wickle are a lien on the land I sold them last May. Now when this confessing judgment is done I know it will be said that I am putting my property out of my hands to avoid other liabilities. Be it so. It is done to pay my own honest debts let the world say what it may. If you can as safely to me & these two widows, sell the lot at private sale let it go. You can write a Power of Atty to yourself from me - I will acknowledge it & return it instantantce to Knoxville. Mrs. B. will inclose some of the claims she holds on me. She is just now searching for them If found I will inclose & send by Express. The one she is looking for will be sent hereafter Deliberate decide wisely & then act. you have thething all in your own hands. These are all the debts I owe except lawyers fees & a small debt to W. Gettys & a larger one two or three hundred dollars perhaps to Lenoir & Bros If you chose you may ask for them & confess judgment too. They were advances to me after the surrender. Be circumspect but dont be too careful of my character. Mens conscia recti sustains me. I feel in all I have done or now authorise you to do, that I am acting honestly. I know I am honest & wish

to protect the widow in her rights, I do. I still believe if you & Covnick will consult the adverse counsel in the B. & A. case the former will comprimise & I can then pay Baxter what he asked last May. Also in the Ludlow case, Van Grulder & Frank Scott thought he would make a fair compromise. Suppose you try & effect this I wrote you yesterday to invest Mrs Rs money in your hands & also that B.l of Tennessee money at Peoples Bank in K. C. Bonds @ 80. Do it soon as they will appreciate as July approaches when the coupons for 1820 will come due. If Brakbill says the note due 2 months after the time you gave him expires invest that also for my wife unless instructed otherws & keep all these assets of my wifes free from attachments Col. Craige told me to day of a judgment or decree that has just been announced by J.C. at W. that confiscated lands of any owner whose lands were confiscated will revert to the heirs. In my case will that not be an inducement for the parties to compromise? Watch this Deem well. I want my heirs to have all I am entitled to. - J.A.M. has acted as I expected Cxpt Warlly writes me that he will have Unnant in the office this month. I will pay my honest debts, Found rilent liabilities I discard & repudiate if I can. If taxes are due on my lot I authorised you or Walley to take out of my wifes RR. of Tenn, money at the Mclelae Bank enough to pay them & preserve or inclose to me the Tax Collectors receipt.. Mrs. Brech asks you to send her U.S. Marshalls reciept for her costs $54.00 She says J.C.R. paid it once before in her presence & she wants it in her own hands. You did right in giving my favorite neice Susy these K. C. Bond Dont let Breakbills ? note be attached nor other assets Write me if my unmailable letter of of the 29th has not arrived Did you take Dr. Doaks picture to your house All well love to Mr J & your family J. G. M. Ramsey

Dear Sir Post Scriptum After I had filled the other sheet I thought of two or three other notes or memoranda of monies due Mrs Ramsey which I now inclose. She & Mrs. Breck have copied them here & I send the originals to you Do all you can with them. Is the one given in Confederate times worth any thing The others are binding on my estate. My assets & valuables were always kept in our vault at Knoxville & on my Hegna south Sep. or Aug. /6 8 & Strong carried them with him & at the surrender at Augusta Arl. 1865 he handed them

Page 6

over to me & I walked & carried my money bou in my hand all the way nearly on foot & brot them thus to Charlotte, Howeve these transactions may appear to the McCual & unjust they are all legitimate & legal Send them back to me if you cannot collect them from sahs of lot. My wife or Executors should have them - One word more about the B. & R. case, G.C.R. wrote to me that my lawyers said that as in the Decree of Cham. Tropy (I believe) all further claims after a certain date were banned & as most holders of the issues were dead or moved away no other suit would be brought & that Lyon & Ramseys costs expenses & servieus as Fosters must all be compensated. What do you think? - Again I dont think you ought to dismiss my suits as Breakbill & Weyh till in the terms of the agreement the consideration be fully paid This will make him prompt to meet his note. Write soon J.G.M.R. The following text is a continuation of the sixth page of the letter. P.S. Perhaps you had not better try to do any thing with Mrs. R.s note for $360.00. If so send it back to me The preceding text is a continuation of the sixth page of the letter.
