Louisville, Ky. Nov. 5 1879 Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey Dear Sir. Thanks for your favor of Oct. 30th with the old poems We will try & return the ms. to you. It is a capital thing -- so quaint in its style, so rich in its religious experience. It will appear on the Obs. of Nov. 12th. If you notice the address label of your paper, you will find that instead of the "date to which paid," opposite your name, there is simply a letter "c." It means that we esteem the help rendered by your pen as a full equivalent for your subscription & have ordered that no bill be sent to you. Please accept of the paper, & continue to help us in the way of correspondence whenever you can. Yours Very Truly Converse & Co.
