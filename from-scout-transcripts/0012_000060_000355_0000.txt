Baltimore July 20, 1824 Dear Sir, In my last I dwelt pretty largely upon our old theme, "the Presidential Election - And if you thought too largely, attribute it to an anxiety that men generally, and you in particular, should have an accurate judgement on a Subject of Such immence importance, to our country, to the world at large, to ourselves, and to posterity - That my exertions are attended with sucess , however that may be ardently wished, is to me, not the great matter, for the reward is, not as to the efforts, but "according to the labour" - one may plant and another may water, but the glory of the increase belongs still to another - Thus much for the present, on the old subject - I have not been inattentive to your request touching the Mecklinburg Declaration - but I regret having to inform you, that my research, as yet, has been productive of nothing important - Niles' Register from No. 1 to the last published No. has been examined, and I am not able to find any thing relation to the Subject - I regret this, not solely that it will be a disappointment to you, but also, that I am thusly deprived of the pleasure of contributing somewhat, towards elucidating a matter, so interesting to the true patriot - I could wish to be intimately conversant with the history of every individual man, concerned in the American Revolution - Not only acquainted with their actions but the operation of their hearts during those trying times - And by the way, I would

remark that he comes far short of a true historian who, forgetting, or thinking it of little importance, to record the secret springs, and to trace out, with discernment of a philospher, and the accuracy of an adept, the first conception, through the labyrinths and anfractuosities of the human mind, until it becomes embodied in words, or is made tangible by their doings; & only aspires to be a chronicle of events as presinted to the eye - I know that you in your account of the Mecklinburg Declaration, will penetrate deeper than the surface - and present to view as will the intellectual and moral process as the event as left upon record - Thence my anxiety to see your production - There is encouragement for you to proceed in the work, in the consideration, that it will show to the world, that the opposition to tyranny and oppression, then manifested, was not a spark lit up, entirely, by the denunciations of the assembled wisdom & patriotism of the "Continental Congress", but that it was a feeling, principle I would rather say, intuitive in the American bosom, and which shone forth with exceeding splendour, at numerous places in the country, without the aid of a preconcent - And our enemies , if any we have, will learn therefrom, the fact, that if it is necessary for the whole mass to be tainted, before the ship will be given up - That to be shorn of our locks, however much they may add to our beauty, is not sufficient, for that our strength is dispersed throughout, and extended to every member of the body politic - And that that strength is felt there - Augt 2d Scott's late novel "Redgauntlett" was published here on Saturday last, - I have not read it - but if you can form an idea of the incidents of the work from the title, it is more than many others can - - I have said Scotts novel

for I do not know why we should have any doubt about that matter, when there appears to be no doubt (or good information) among his immediate neighbours as to the circumstances - True Sir W. has survived some of the Waverly family, but this no doubt was only move effectivally to blind the puclick; besides, I am informed, however improper it may be, that this is not their first instance of the kind, that has occured in Edinburg, of an author reviewing his own production - So that fact is no longer of any value, as evidence of his not being the author - "The actor of Bailie Jarvis , one of the characters in Rob Roy, recd. a present of guineas in a note signed Jed. Cleishbottom , as a mark his approbation, and it is pretty well known that the note came from the desk of the sipious " Grisom's Year in Europe To the author, be him who he may, my individual thanks are due, not only for the source of amusement his works have been to me, but they have had the effect of disgusting me with all other novel writers ancient or modern, with a few exceptions - This I consider quite a happy circumstance - There may be some of the "blue stocking" familys who would think me more happy were they given up in toto - Inform them, if you know any people who come under that description, that I would have no objection to try the experiment, provided they would, first, procure for me some other employment, to fill up the time, now devoted to that species of reading, that will be equally innocent and amusing - Griscom's Year in Europe" - A journal of a tour in Europe occupying the space of a year, by Professor Griscom, of New York, a member of the Society of Friends, published the latter part of last year, and which I have just read, I found to please me very much - I send you herewith a Sermon by the Revd. Mr. Duncan of this place - the title page will inform you on what occasion it was preached - I consider Mr. Duncan - the most powerful preacher of the Gospel I ever heard - And my over

opportunity of judging has not been very slight for I have been a pretty constant bearer of his, since 1814 abating the time I was in thhe west - There an unhappy controversy between Mr Duncan, and some of the members of his sission and congregation, going on for some time - It is thought that, Mr D. is too liberal in his opposition of the Gospel, and not paying sufficient deference to the ascensions , of some of the "Fathers" of the Presbyterian Church Such as Calvin - and the ministers who composed the famed Westminster Assembly &c, Mr D's course differs somewhat from that of the generality of preaching principally in this subject - he takes any of the books of the N. Testament, and from the beginning goes on with his exposition until the book is gone through - generall establishing his view of the Subject from other portions of the Scriptures - always referring to the Bible, as authority, paramount to that of confissions or cruds, reason, experience, or the opinions of men, however profound they are, or may have been; thinking himself, aided by the Spirit of his office, as capable of a fair and just exposition as any of them - Is it not (do you judge), too commonly the case, that ministers of the Gospel, take up some of the doctrines found in the system of theology taught them at the Schools, and searching out passages of Scripture, through which a coincidence of doctrine is found to run, and taking up such passages as their texts, deducing from the whole, the very doctrines, found at the commencement of their course, and which is oftentimes the caption itsilf - you will be able to understand Mr Duncan much better from the perusel of his sermon, than from any description of mine - You see my paper is full, and the post horn's blowing, altho I break off leaving half that I have to say unsaid - V.B.M.
