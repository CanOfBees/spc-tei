Madison May 21st. 1874 My Dear Dr. Ramsey -- Glad to hear from you again. I send you our Circular. It has been used in our volumes & otherwise, with but slight change for 20 years. These are some points you shd. put more stress on than others in yr appeal: 1st old bus. , letters &e relating to Tenne. history -- & the late war -- diaries. 2d narratives & statements by surviving actors, or those cognizant of facts 3d newspaper files are vastly important for such a society. P.S. 2d -- Has an old collection of yr. society been preserved?

4. Plead for pamphlets of every kind, especially relating to Tenne. or its institutions. Your secretary shd. find last names of surviving prominent men -- & representatives of prominent men who have passed away & make a special appeal to them for appropriate matter -- often stowed away in garrets or closets. I am glad you are placed as an head of yr. institution. If you can give it the right start, you will have done a good work. But you must make up yr. minds that you can't succeed without money -- either a good endowment, or state aid. God bless you!Truly yours, Lyman C. Draper Do you think yr. society wd. consent to loan me the vol. of So. Car. Advr. 1789 &e for a brief period by & by? I paying freight charges both ways?
