Madison, July 15th, 1880. My Dear Dr. Ramsey -- Since I wrote you the other day, I recovered your mislaid letter about Parson Doak. Yesterday in writing up the route of the King's Mountain Men, I was struck with some of your statements -- 143: 1st You say 4th of Oct. when they reached Gilbert Town. I should hardly think you go that from Shelby's account because I find nothing to warrant it in the official report by the 3 Colonels -- not in Haywood, & not in Shelby's acct. as dictated to Hardin. He does say abt. the 1st of Oct. in Haywood, they were joined by Cleveland -- & two days after was raining, when they did not move, but held the council & appointed Campbell, & next mom-

marched towards Gilbert Town, 16 or 18 miles away -- & this would make it about the 4th Oct. But the official report signed by Campbell, Shelby, & Cleveland, makes it 30th Sept. when Cleveland joined them -- hence it would have been the 3rd of Oct. they reached Gilbert Town. We mist not go behind the records, when we have any. On p. 233 of your History you speak of Ferguson's march over Broad river to the Cow pens -- this would make him marching towards the west. I suppose, however, you meant Pacolet -- this you say was the 4th, & next day he crossed at Dean's Ferry, & camped about a mile above, & the next day, the 6th he marched abt. 14 ms to King's Mtn. Where did you get these dates & statements? It seems to me with the lights before me -- especially Col. Wm. Hill's ms (one of the S. Car. Cols.) that they are not reliable; & Ferguson's letter to Lord Cornwallis, without date, indicates that he crossed Broad River, not at Dean's Ferry, but considerably below, at the Cherokee Hand -- that he marched along the road from Cherokee Hand leading north at Kings Mtn. He must have reached there at least as early as 4th Oct. Very Truly Yours, Lyman C. Draper.
