Charles Pettit Esqr Philada. Bermuda 20th May 1806 Sir We wrote you in Original and Duplicate under the 28th, tttto, which we doubt not you have received. Since then and on the 14th Inst. part of the Cargo of the Ship Columbian Packed was Sold as Vendue, by Order of the Court of N. Admiralty say all the Brandy, Fruit, Pickles, Almonds and Some of the Wine _ the Brandy 5/5 a Cas. pGal. Fruit $7 pCase, the other Articles we cannot Speak particularly of more than, that a small shipment of Wine in Cases sold at about $6. pdoz. there was a few Shots Claret bid off at about $14 pShot, these not appearing a disposition to bid more for it, the Marshall Stoped the Sale. the other Articles of the Cargo rests as when Captn. Warrington left this, and it is likely that such part of the Cargo as is not likely to injure by lying, will remain as if a final Decree is given, when that will be, is quite uncertain, as we presume the Captors have an expectation/or pretended so/ of producing some proofs favorable to them that were taken in Some of the vessels from Bordeaux, and carryed to Halifax With great Respect we are Sir Your Most Hum Servts James &Wm. Perot
