Cumberland Courthouse Aug. 14th 1782 Dear Col. I wrote you last December, & again in April, but have never been Honerd honored with a Line in return this Autumn I fancy we shall have all the news forthward, & and if you do not turn out a better Correspondent, believe me you shall not have a tittle of news - every thing at present is perfectly quiet. The French Fleet which lanchd at our Capes gone to Rhodistans whether in some enterprise, or to refit is still a doubt-- In my last I took the liberty to accompany Lieut A. Campbell to you for an appointment in your Reg. if possible, & agreeable. He is a worthy Young Man, who wishes much to serve in the Calvary, He is the Son of the Old Heroe who fell at Eutaw, I fancy you were acquainted with him. I shall be very happy to hear from you as soon as possible. From Dear Col. Your most obedt hbl Servt. P. Muhlenberg
