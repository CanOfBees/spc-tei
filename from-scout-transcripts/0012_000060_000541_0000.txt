Easter Sunday 1030 Spruce St Philadelphia I have thought of you this Easter Sunday Dear Mrs Ramsay - & as I do not go out this afternoon, shall send a few lines of greeting, thinking you will like to hear from me. We are all pretty well & hope the trials of a severe winter are over, but all have colds & coughs still, & my daughter has just recovered from an acute attack of rheumatism, which kept her in bed a week. Spring is coming soon, they say, & occasionally we have a summer day, & again cold, & windy.

My little Esther is doing very well at school, & learning as well as we can expect -- I have no doubt now that she will use speech, & perhaps not be recognized as a mute. My daughter is much interested in her Art studies, & hopes to complete her course here, this spring -- her school closes the last day of May, & we hope to leave the first day of June -- probably shall spend a few days in Knoxville -- when I shall certainly see you. I have never lived in so large a City before -- there are nearly a million of inhabitants -- & many beautiful things to see -- but I

am sure much wickedness & suffering. I think the South is better for not having large Cities. There are numberless Churches, in every direction, some very high, so that you would fancy yourself in a Roman Catholic Church -- most of them fashionable -- where I find it difficult to feel it is a church -- but many where I have been much interested -- My children have relations here, who are very kind to us -- a first cousin of their fathers, older than I am, married a Philadelphian, long ago, & her children settled here, so that we do not feel altogether as in a strange land.

My married daughter, Mrs Elliott, has returned to her summer home in Sewanee, & we shall be very happy when the time comes for us to join her -- indeed I fear we shall all be home sick as soon as warm weather commences, but we came here for a special object, & I hope will be able to remain the allotted time -- Hoping to see you before very long, & with kind love to your daughter, believe me affectionately your friend Mary E Huger 1030 Spruce Street, Philadelphia Penn April 6th
