not that you or any of the family should become the publisher. The friends whose names are mentioned in the Will as proper as noberus on this matter may accept or not the duty there assigned or may decline it as they choose should They think any of the papers deserve to be published & should you receive an offer worthy of your consideration. I do not object that you agree to accept the offer but only on this conditioning that nothing personally offensive or impervious to the character of the living or the dead be inserted but erased or suppressed. I remember of no such instance but if such is found, draw your own pen through the sentence before you hand the manuscript to any publisher

As to the amount you should ask for the manuscripts I make no limit. It is your own I am not vain in saying there is money in it. dont part with them for a trifel or a song. I know you will preserve the whole of them confidently & leave them to those of our family who will appreciate them. Very affectionately My Dear Liddy Your devoted Father J.G.M. Ramsey Mecklenburg Place July 3, 1882.
