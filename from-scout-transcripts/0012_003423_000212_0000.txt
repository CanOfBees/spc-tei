Camp Moore Dec. 22nd 1861 Dear Sister! As I have not had the pleasure of hearing from you for a long time I take great pleasure of writing to you since William Starnes told me that you are well & enjoying happiness Since the fight at Belmont nothing new has happened here and as we have not now the chance nor means of buying papers we know but little of what happens elsewhere. I expect to heare a good deal from you next, having more leisure time & inclination I expect than I at present. For several weeks we have been busy building houses for winter quarters which causes us a good deal of work. I have mine nearly finished and the fire in the chimney these cold days and nights is very agreable. It is but a short time now till christ mass but the prospects of any fun on that occasion as in former times is any thing but favorable. We shall not be allowed to go to town and having no money we shall not be able to buy any thing that is brought into camp. Pies, cakes, eggs etc are therefore alltogether out of the question. As fare as clothing is concerned we have plenty. Every man has an overcoat 2 dresscoats 3 or 4 pairs of pants 2 or 3 pairs of shoes. I have got 3 pair of yarn socks and lots of underclothing. We have plenty to eat of beef, pork coffee sugar, rice etc.
