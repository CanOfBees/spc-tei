Madison May 21st, 1874. My Dear Dr. Ramsey -- I wrote you hastily this morning -- so as to hurry off to you the Circular you denied. You mention that Wheeler in his Hist. of N.C. states that Capt. Craighead was on Rutherford's campaign. I have looked to find such a record -- but my eye fails to discover it. If you set your eye on it again, cite me to it. I suspect you refer to Hanging Rock -- Wheeler, 11, 194? --

I am only making good progress in the sinister work in perfecting my materials. Where in N.C. did you make the acquaintance with Ex--Gov. Graham of Greensboro? The late Gov. Swain had Gov. Davies' Ms -- as you see in Wheeler's N.C., giving accts. of Rocky Mount & Hanging Rock. Ms. Swain accorded me permission to have copies taken -- through Judge Battle, when it was found Gov. Swain had loaned the Davie Ms. to Gov. Graham -- & he kindly promised Judge Battle, & afterwards Col. Wm. Johnston that the wd. have a transcript made & sent me. This a year ago or more. I wrote Gov. Graham again in Hale.port I hear nothing. I think his intentions are good. But I really wish a full and accurate transcript -- Wm. Wheeler gives in the main probably, yet I know that some things are omitted . Send me newspaper accts. of yr. society's meetings & progress. Yours truly -- Lyman C. Draper
