Allegheny City May 1st/65 My Dear David I have just risen from the breakfast table and sat down to write you a few lines hoping they may find you in good health and spirits as we enjoy a goodly share of each of these comforts ourselves I hope the day is not far distant l when you will be home again I do hope it's so for I tell you there is no fun in trying to do so long alone with as many boys as we have I hope before you start that you will get all those greybacks killed and green backs in their place it would pay a good deal better such hard times I must tell how proud Tommy is about his report he got No 1 with 15 perfect lessons; one imperfect no failures a pretty nice report for a little boy the other boys got Jimmie 9 Andie 3 a bad report indeed for such big boys but it is as good as they deserve

I hav not written to Mr Patterson for I have no doubt but some member of the christian commission would attend to writing to his wife as they allways do in such cases I have not got any news to write that I can think of I have not seen Robert since the day that Father was buried I met Tilly in market I see Hannah & Andie in church but that is all I have seen James but once since May was here after Mother died I have not heard from them since Sharon Meegan went home I have grown quite as selfish as they have I am very caring if people dont want to visit me they can let it alone our grapevine is so nice this morning I do not think the little one is going to have any grape on this year Annas face seems to be a little better but I think I shall go to warner for her he is very dear but I dont care for that if he cures her
