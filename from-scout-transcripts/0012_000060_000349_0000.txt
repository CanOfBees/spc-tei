15th July P.S. If there is any Mourning Grape in any of the Stores near you, will you please to take the earliest opportunity and get as many yards on my account as will make a scarf for yourself - and each of my Brother-inlaws and Sister inlaws of which I consider the present Mrs Caldwell one - and request them all to wear them awhile in rememberance of my Dear deceased wife - the amount I will pay you for if Divine Providence permits me ever to see you again if not it can be transmitted to you - James Cormer Esquire of your County calls me for three years taxes I've paid upon his 1000 acres of land in Anderson County. I have not time now to look at the Receipts and know the amount I have paid for him - Your son in Duty and affection. F.A.R.

N.B. You can all of you read jointly the letters I have addressed to each on this occasion, as I have tried as much as my troubled mind would let me not to give quite the same information in each letter F.A.R.
