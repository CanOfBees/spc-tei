City Treasurer's Office, Anson Nelson, City Treasurer. Nashville, March 18, 1880 Dear Dr. Ramsey: I forgot to state, in my late letters, that I would see Judge Guild and urge him to invite Hon. Lyman C. Draper, of Madison, Wisconsin, to come to our Centennial. Further, that I will answer any letter written me by Mr. Draper. Two, three or four years ago, Mr. Draper wrote to me for some information on regard to some one in Maury County. I handed the letter to Dr. W.A. Smith, of Columbia, a member of the Society, with

a regard to him to reply. He said he would, and I suppose did, but I never knew. So I did not answer, and not having the letter, could not do so, for I could not remember what he wrote about. I find it difficult to see Judge Guild, as I was unfortunate in not finding him in his office when I call. With very high regard, and with the love of Mrs. Nelson and myself, I remain yours, Very Truly, Anson Nelson.

City Treasurer's Office, Anson Nelson, City Treasurer. Nashville, March 18, 1880 (Private). Dr. E.L. Drake, now of this city, formerly of Fayetteville is disposed to work on your School History if necessary, and supervise its publication. He ca do any additional writing necessary. He has no money to advance towards its publication, and it may be that capital will be necessary. But I have talked with him about it once or twice, and he seems disposed to go to work on it, if he can be remunerated for his labor

and at the same time see you remunerated. He has talked to Col. Trousdale, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and he says he will do all he can to have it introduced into all public schools of the State, if it is printed. I would be glad for you to write to Dr. Drake or to me in relation to the matter. Very Respectfully Anson Nelson
