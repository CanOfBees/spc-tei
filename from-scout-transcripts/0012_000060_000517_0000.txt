Madison, Oct 2nd 1883. Mrs. Dr. Ramsey -- My Respected Friend -- I do not know that Dr. Ramsey ever visited the Boone bear tree, north of Jonesboro. He says, p. 68 of his History, that "Boone's camp is still pointed near the banks of Boone's Creek." This may be about as Mr. Cammon told it to him. The old settlers in the Boone tree region have no knowledge of the locality of the camp = one suggests that it was at Bean's Spring - some 300 yards West of Boone's Creek - in a rough, rocky locality. If Dr. Ramsey has any recollection about the camp

locality, I beg you will inform me as minutely as you can. You will see that you & the Doctor's friend - by the magazine I send you - is Kept before the public - not of his seeking. While there things do no good as I can see, they are harmless. I hope & pray that you both are in comfortable health. God kindly bless you both! Very Truly Yours, Lyman C. Draper.
