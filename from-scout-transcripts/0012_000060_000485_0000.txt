Mecklenburg Place January 12. 1882. I have felt convinced for a long time past that my intellectual & bodily abilities are every day becoming so impaired & enervated as to render me incompetent for the proper discharge of my duty & having experienced through the whole of life of my son J.G. McKnitt Ramsey the fullest evidence of his capacity & diligence & willingness to execute his whole duty faithfully & will I hereby assign, transfer & invest in him all such acts, duties & obligations as ordinarily have or do devolve upon me hereby confirming the same. In In testimony whereof I set my hand & seal this day I date above written. J.G.M. Ramsey
