McMinville Tennessee July 26th, 63 Brother William It is with pleasure that I once more take my pen in hand to address you a few lines & let you know that I am well and hearty. I am sorry that I can send you no more money but I had my pocket picked last night while I was in swimming in the river and it serves me right for not taking better care of my things in fortune. The weather is very hot now but there is a little breeze blowing most all the time, which makes it bearable, for us Yanks as the rebels eqlly.

The 4th of July was celebrated around the united states in different ways but it was celebrated down at Vicksburg about right to my notion This little Gun and bayonet breastpin I am going to give to little William for a present but it is not very nice but still it will look well enough if it is brightened up a little I got it in a package of paper and envelopes that I bought We are on duty regular every other day either on picket or camp guard but I hope that such things will play out in the course of another year.
