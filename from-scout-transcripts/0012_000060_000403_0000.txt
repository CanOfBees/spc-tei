Wednesday Morning Dec 20. 1871 My Dear Liddy Willie brought us out last night yours of the 15th with Robs P.S. MKnitts of the 13.th. &I reply hastily to all of them. We were glad to hear that you got to Charlotte so well you must not discard Genl. Sorry for not meeting you at the Depot. The train that brought your Ma & me to Knoxville also brought to senoirs a letter to me from him (forwarded next mail to me at K / advising that you should not start till the night train & that he would certainly meet you & give all the facilities he could possibly do at Atlanta. He is a polite gentleman & will I know feel sorry that you did not receive his advise before you left Lenoirs . We came on Wednesday A.M. to town. I went with your Ma in the Buss to W. Deadericks gate & then came immediately home & found then all were leaving her there where she remained till Saturday. Parmatier sent her out in his finest carriage? She had spent the time very pleasantly & seems now very well yesterday Cornelia sent her Harper Putnams & other Magazines & reading matter enough to last her all winter. Besides I had got her some fine yarn & she began her knitting & will have employment all the time I am quite well & Thursday went up to Jacob Hufaires (11 miles) to see some patients - staid all night & next day came home without fatigue - & have visited others since. M. J. is quite well & the boys too. Tell Mknitt that one of my letters must have miscarried as I wrote in full about Lues Bond & now repeat that they are worth 85 units - the coupon $3.00 is nearly due.

& she ought to cut it off before selling it - The stock ought to bring par as it is 6 per cent payable in N.Y. Tell Mknitt to say to Mr. Williams that I have not found time to write any thing about Ropurwell yet I will see Charleston & get him to rent your house & lot soon & try to make you some money out of it. If MK. was here I think he could find something to do. Times are very tight tho & many are discouraged about business. It snowed last night & the room is so cold that my letter is hardly legible & Millie is ready to stand. Your next will give us something about Joe Bactir Jimmie Andie & the rest Kiss them all for me. I hope W K will come out in Jany Parmatier wrote him last week- Love to you & all the friends Affectionately J. G. M. Ramsey.
