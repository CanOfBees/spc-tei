Knoxville Dec 18th Dear Sir Brokebill backed out from his trade - the reason he gave for it was that he was not able to get the money. I told him that he ought have told me that before we made the trade - he agreed to pay me twenty five dollars for my trouble and I let him off. I however sold the land in a few days afterwards to George Woods . I have got a little better trade with him than Brokebill - he will pay me three hundred dollars the 1st of Jan

What will I do with the money. Enclosed you will find a deed which Lizzie can sign and acknowledge according to former instructions. See that the Notary Public states "with whome I am personally acquainted". Return it to me as soon as you can and I will close the trade at once I dont intend this to be a childs bargain - Sneed has gained his case and Crozier and Reynolds will both gain their cases as they are on the same principle - we expect to try both cases this court I fear we will not be able to try your cases or Macks

this court. I have great confidence in gaining them as seom of the questions that are involved in Sneeds cases are also in yours. I received a long letter from Ma some time ago and intend to answer it after Court is over and I may be better prepared to answer it then than now. I however should think that as winter has not set in - it would be best not to return until Spring. We have no news of interest - all well - Love to all I have not the time to write you a longer letter Yours truly J.C. Ramsey
