Franklin, Tenn. Nov. 24, 1910 My dear Mrs. Breck:- I loaned my "tree" to Mr. Sharpe of Nashville & have just gotten it home. I have made a rough sketch of your branch of the family, which I am sending you, hoping it will give you pleasure. The next time I go to Nashville, will see if I can get some paper, such as the Architects use, & sketch the whole tree for you. James Alexander is the founder of the N.C. branch

the tree does not give the date of his birth - or the name of his wife. I wrote to Bessie Caldwell, (now Mrs. Archibald Young) of Charlotte, N.C. She is a grand daughter of Rev. Samuel Chraighead Caldwell - She was just moving into a new home & said as soon as she was settled would write to me. Said Charlotte was the place to find out all about the Alexanders - When I hear from her will write you what she says - The following is a list of the children of James Alexander

grand daughter of Adam Alexander who settled in Washington Ga. She says he had no brothers or sisters, & left only one son Adam L. Alexander. He came to this country as the Revolution broke out - had just graduated at the University of Edinburg Scotland. Her grandfather went to Yale, & married a Miss Glibert there. Adam seems to have been a family name - & I think her father must be a descendent of the same strock .

All I find out in regard to the family, will let you know. If you will place the sketch of the tree I send over white paper, you can see it more plainly. With love, & best wishes Nellie A. Gordon
