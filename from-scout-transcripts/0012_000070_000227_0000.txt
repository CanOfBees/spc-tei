Sevierville June 10 1865 Col temple I wish to consult you in the case of my niece, Evaline Moon, I will give you the facts as near as I can. About 4 years ago her Husband John Moon loaned about $300 to Porter McCulloch & Robert McCamy - It was state money - they presented Confederate money Moon refused to receive it, they threatened to report him and to have him punished for refusing it. he was notified to leave the country for his refusal of Confederate money Moon left home & joined the federal army and has been dead nearly two years his widow has the confederate money that was forced upon her Husband, I wish to know if she can get damages for the Banishment of her Husband, and for the loss she has sustained in the money - she has no heirs, and there is no Administrator appointed. The land of McCamy was put in pledge for the payment of the note, it has since been sold, can it be held for the money loaned, you are requested if the case can be reached to attend to it and if it can I wish the suit to be commenced in this County we will sue some Reb in sevier, and issue counterparts, both the defendants are non residents, please write to me by my son next week and oblige your friend William M Burnett
