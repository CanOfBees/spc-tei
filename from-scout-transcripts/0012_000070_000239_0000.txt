Maryville, April 26 1862 Col O. P. Temple Dear Sir Yours of 21st in consequence of high waters & irregularities of the mails was not recv'd until this evening. The proclamation of the President suspends " All civil jurisdiction" within the District of East Tennessee with certain exceptions therein setforth; and proceedings of the Confederate Courts under the Regnestration act are not among the exceptions. I am compelled therefore to believe that nothing under that act can now be done in the courts or out of the courts, until & unless one can obtain a mortificataion of the proclamation. I hope that may be done.- the act of Congress March 13 1861 requires the forms and modes of preceding both in the trial & progress of suits, both in Law & equity in the Confederate courts to be the same as are in use in the courts of original jurisdiction in the states in which the court is held. This dispenses with, as I conceive, all the forms & rules of the U.S. Courts in the taking of depositions. Anyhow, & at all events, whenever there is nothing in the way of our civil

jurisdiction. I am willing to waive formal notice and to let you take your deposition by the shortest process possible. Would it not, however, be better for you to refer the matter to Mr. Haynes & Mr. Campbell, the Receivers? Yours respectfully, Jesse G. Wallace J G Wallace April 1862
