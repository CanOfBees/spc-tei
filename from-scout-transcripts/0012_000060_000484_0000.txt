Sonnet. Respectfully dedicated to Dr. J.G.M Ramsey, Christmas Day, 1881. I thank thee, O my God, that once, once more, My well beloved and venerable friend Beholds a Christmas day! And mayst Thou send More still, and more, till farther on Time's shore Than Xenophon, his prototype, of yore Who like my friend, his country's history penned. He shall his life's delightful journey wend Unto the Styx's tide and Charon's oar. O, Friend of long, long years, beloved and True, Thy country's friend, and mine! If earnest prayer Of mine can aught avail, fond bliss the surest Shall e'er be thine thy glorious future through -- Increasing love of friends, health, pleasure, here, Joys infinite in Heaven, exalted, purest! W.G. McAdoo Knoxville, Tennessee, Christmas Day, 1881.
