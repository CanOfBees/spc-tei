PASTED ON INSIDE FRONT COVER[newspaper clipping]BRUISED, NOT BROKEN."And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
								shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall
								there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."
								Rev. 21, 4.From out the depths profound of bitter anguish, Through tears, oh
								God, I lift my eyes to thee; Thy tearless eyes see where the smitten
								languish; From heaven, thy far off heaven, where all is bliss, One
								pitying look, Creator, turn on me.As fugitives and vagabonds we wander, Thine erring children, exiled
								far away; Our sins and miseries in gloom we ponder, The death-brand
								on ourselves and all we love, Through darkness watching for the
								break of day.With sobbing wretchedness, our best affection We bury from our sight,
								and helpless grope Where Death holds fondest hearts in grim
								subjection, Mid that drear stillness longing for one voice, One
								balm, one whisper, that might thrill new hope.Yet near the grave's shut door I still must linger;
								Eternity's closed portal; gate of heaven; Oh! rend the stone,
								redeemer! With thy finger! Let me look through and see my loved with
								thee! The words once let me hear, "Redeemed!
								Forgiven!"The wind, while gently now the long grass bending With billowy
								undulations, ebbs and flows; Now, to the trees, like unseen giant
								lending A strength sublime, they toss their mighty shades, And where
								'twas dank and dark, a sunbeam glows.The unseen wind still "bloweth where it listeth;" Spirit
								divine! disperse this sullen gloom; Oh breathe that breath which on
								one e'er resisteth; Down through the rifted sky thy radiance
								pour, And waft my heart and faith above the tomb."My child! thou hast mistaken all thy story; No fugitive, no
								vagabond art thou; Yet but a little while I screen my glory;
								Baptized in grief, thy heaven shall open soon; My Dove is lighting
								on thee, even now!Before the sepulchre, the great stone lying, Soon, for thy coming,
								shall be rolled away, and thou shalt enter, not to doubts and
								crying, but loved and loving, holy and serene, Translated to my home
								and endless day."THE FIRST GREEN LEAF.By Mattie Winfield.'Tis a tiny little thing, Herald of the coming spring; First to
								burst its winding sheet, First the balmy spring to greet, Bravely
								ushered into life 'Mid the elemental strife, Nurtured well by
								wind and storm, Which assailed its outer form.Deftly shaped and folded well, It has lain within its cell Through
								the long and dreary time, Whilst the winter ruled the clime; Fast
								asleep and dreaming oft Of the blue sky up aloft, Of the sun which
								soon should fall Warm and lightsome over all:Dreaming of the summer rain, Falling soft o'er hill and plain;
								Of the balmy zephyr's sigh, And the south wind stealing by; Of
								the sweetest odors breathed Where the summer flowers are wreathed
								Dreaming thus, with its cell, Folded close and guarded well.But there came a magic word, And its little heart was stirred With a
								wish for liberty; So it struggled to be free Till the bonds which
								held it broke And the tiny leaf awoke, And a world, untried and new
								Burst upon its startled view.So I plucked it from the bough, Placed it where it greets me now. As
								I gaze upon it here, Soft it whispers in my ear: Spring is coming!
								soon her voice Shall the waiting earth rejoice; Soon with bird, and
								bee, and flower, She shall charm each passing hour.Spring is coming! Let the strain Fall upon my ear again: Let the
								silent air be stirred By the magic of the word. Spring is coming!
								Spring is here! Lo! her vernal robes appear, For this tiny, winsome
								thing Is the first green leaf of spring.THE TWILIGHT OPPORTUNITY.What loving mother does not know value of the twilight hour, when
								children tired of play, or interrupted in chosen amusements by the
								waning light unconsciously attracted to her side by cheerful
								fireside's glow? The day's boisterous mirth is subdued and
								the troubles  disappointments of the
								day are softened  forgotten in this
								charmed hour. Mother  Admonition is
								then more tenderly given, more gently received; and the little sec
									 and confessions, which might
								shrink  daylight, are now confidingly
								poured into  loving ear.HEAVEN.The golden palace of my God Towering above the clouds I see; Beyond
								the cherub's bright abode, Higher than angels' thoughts
								can be. How can I in those courts appear Without a wedding garmet
								on? Conduct me, thou Life-giver, there, Conduct me to thy glorious
								throne! And clothe me with thy robes of light, And lead me through
								sin's darksome night My saviour and god. -Russian PoetrySEE the ice, how hard it is! But two o'clock comes, there is a
								great heat the sun, and the ice melts

								nor delayed by spleen; And true to nature's regulating power,
								By virtuous acts distinguish every hour: Then health and joy would

								Sweet health to pass the present moments o'er, And everlasting
								joy when time shall be no more.We wish to close our eyes upon the world in the places we love best;

								pressed me to his heart With knightly courtesy.His gallant plume waved in the breeze His sword was on his thigh, He
								looked the very god of war Though love beamed from his eye."I go," he said, "where glory calls "But tell me,
								ere we part, "Dost thou pledge to me for weal or woe "Thy
								gently maiden heart?"Dost give to me this little hand? "Wilt ever constant be?
								"And dost thou promise me to wait "Till I return to
								thee?"He bent his head yet nearer mine-- I whispered low the vow; One
								silent tear rolled down his cheek And fell upon my brow.He pressed me closer to his heart, Then hurried down the lane-- I
								little thought that day, alas! He'd ne'er come back
								again.But every day at even tide, I kneel beneath you tree, And humbly
								breath afresh my vow, "To ever constant be."atchogue, Long Island, April 25, 1864.To The God of Nations.BY THEODORE TILTON.O Thou before whose Throne we fall, Who bendest to the bended knee,
								Who spurnest none, who lovest all,-- How long O God, from land and
								sea, Shall yet the groaning nations call?O Thou by whom the lost are found, Whose Cross, upraised, forever
								stands, When shall its shadow on the ground Spread East and West
								through all the lands, Until it gird the world around?O Thou who makest kingdoms Thine, When shall Thy mighty arms outreach
								From Southern palm to Northern pine, To bind each human heart to
								each, And each to Thee as branch to vine?O Thou who cleansest human sin, For whom the whole creation waits,
								When shall Thy reign on earth begin?-- O be ye lifted up, ye gates,
								And let the King of Glory in.--Independent.A MONODY OF LIFETo him who righty scans his life Reviewing deeds and years, How vast
								its sum of evil seems! How small its good appears.Evil looms up a forest dark Of thrifty Upas trees; Good seems a
								feeble undergrowth Imps might uproot with ease.Our hearts are garners, whence we sow The fields of life with seed,
								Each of the readiest to grow, Grows up an evil deed.I gather all my flock of deeds-- The least, the most remote-- Each
								noble one I call a sheep, Each evil one a goat.Then, like a shepherd, carefully The herd I separate, And first,
								place every beast of vice With its own vicious mate.Now unto these I say "Depart! And having fixed their doom, I
								turn to greet my goodly sheep With "All ye blessed,
								come!"Lo! a few sickly dwarfish things With me as sheep abide, While all
								the strongest of my flock Are on the vicious side."Trust in the Lord and aye do good, A bard inspired hath said,
								"So shalt thou dwell within the land And, verily, shalt be
								fed."Why am I spared? not Godly trust Detains me from the grave; Why am I
								fed? not doing good Secures the bread I have.But of thy mercy, Lord it is That I am not consumed, That I have days
								of grace instead Of being dead and doomed.James H. BurkWHAT IS THE USE?What is the use of trimming a lamp, If you never intend to light it?

								Yet do I dream of fife and drumbeat' rattle Over the ground;
								Seeing the starry flag its folds out-flinging Upon the breeze,
								Hearing the sound of martial voices ringing Among the trees.The clattering tramp of many chargers prancing That heavy tread, The
								glittering light of shining bayonets glancing Above the dead. The
								shouts, the shrieks, the groans of deadly anguish Break on the ear;
								While on the upturned face of dead and dying The sun shines
								clear.I do not love to read the dark dim future, Even in dreams; Above the
								cloud that lowers o'er our country The light still gleams. And
								in the hand of Him who yet reigns o'er us I rest in peace,
								Trusting that in no distant time before us This war will cease.PARTING.AN OLD GERMAN FOLK-SONG.MORROW must I forth from here, Forth at dawn to-morrow; All too soon
								doth morning come, Seems it wings to borrow. Home to leave is sad I
								find, But my Love to leave behind, This is saddest sorrow!When two folks are right good friends, They will quarrel never; Sun
								and moon would first fall out, Ere such friends would sever. How
								much worse is then the smart, When two loving hearts must part, Part
								perhaps for ever.Kiss thee on the hands or cheeks, Little breezes playing; Think that
								these are sighs of mine, Out strange lands here straying. Thousands
								send I daily out, Which go float the house about, Where my Love is
								staying.Don't undertake to use big words with-out being first sure as
								the exact calibre of your mouth.It is a rare thing for a man or woman to be in love with more than
								one at a time. Love sometimes carries double, but not often.Posthumous charities are the very essence of selfishness when
								bequeathed by those who, when alive, would part with nothing. THEY HEAR OF THIS AT HOME?THE battle trembled in the scale! Charge followed charge through
								smoke and fire. Strong men stood deathly still and pale, To see the
								rebel lines grow nigher! Our colonel, brave as brave could be, Rode
								down our line through showers of flame, And shouted, "Comrades,
								will you see Your well-worn colors blush with shame?"His voice closed up the broken line, And from our ranks a stripling
								flew, He said, "The task alone be mine To plant our honored
								flag anew!" Then with a cheer he sped away, He seemed to spurn
								the ground beneath, And like a hunted stag at bay, He waved it in
								the traitors' teeth.A storm of bullets round him rained, As with a shout we onward
								pressed, But ere our patriot guide we gained The lifeblood stained
								his gallant breast. We raised him from the shell-ploughed sod, His
								white lips full with bloody foam, And heard amid his prayers to God,
								"Oh! will they hear of this at home?"An expert seaman is tried in a tempest, runner in a race, a captain
								in a battle, a Christian in adversity.Monday Jan 11th 1864the day clear and cold this day went to Strawberry plains after clothing and

								being transfer-red from the steamers to the ambulances which were to
								convey them to the hospitals, a prominent lady from Michigan was
								observ-ed looking anxiously to ascertain if either of her sons were
								among the number. She soon espied one of them with his arm shot off
								above the wrist, and the blood still trickling down from it, sitting
								upon a coffin. "Where is Charles?" said she. "In
								this," said the undaunted hero, pointing to his seat. The lady
								could not refrain from weeping, and many of those present were much
								affected by the grief of the mother. She had another son upon the
								battle field, from whom she could obtain no tidings.A WHITE MAN TURNING BLACK.--The Philadelphia Age gives a long
								description of the sin-gular case of Gustavus Brest, a native of
								Germany, who has been in this country for 15 years, and for most of
								that time a workman in a cotton factory at Manayunk Pa. He is a
								single man, of temperate habits, and 45 years of age. In the autumn
								of 1861 he was taken with spotted fever, from which he recovered,
								and the spots disappeared in due time. In August last dark purple
								spots appeared on the back of each hand, and on each instep, giving
								no pain, but increasing in size until nearly the whole surface of
								the body has been covered with a bronze hue. His nose is as
								decidedly dark as the skin of an Abyssinian, his cheeks are more of
								a coffee color. The palms of his hands and the soles of his feet are
								as white as they ever were. His health is remarkably good--it never
								was better. Within the past month a deeper shade has been added to
								the skin. Neither the microscope nor the investi-gations of the most
								learned physicians have found any cause for this singular
								transformation.SPIRITS AND ANGELS.LONELY musing in the twilight, When the lengthening shadows fall,
								Spirits bright and holy Angels Come obedient to my call: Lost and
								loved ones gone before me, Phantoms fair from memory won, Seem to
								flit before my Fancy, Midway to the setting sun.I can see them, robed in Beauty, Some rejoicing, some forlorn,
								Friendly all, and sent to guide me Out of Darkness into Morn. On the
								chimes I hear their voices Whispering solace form the skies. Holy

								the levee, dressed, out of compliment to his northern subjects, in
								the garb of the Gael, it became a matter of etiquette discussion,
								whether or not it would be proper to hold the drawing room in the
								same uniform of plaid and kilt. The peeresses and other ladies held
								a council on the subject, at which opinions ran almost uni- versally
								against this mode of adorning the royal person. It was observed,
								however, that Lady H-had said nothing, and, as she had great
								influence, her judgement was solicited. "Why," replied

								of thieves, who were a great annoy ance to the neighborhood of B---,
								in that State: One night they went to a house where they knew there
								was money. After much parleying as to who should go in, one of them
								named Bob, the junior of the two, vol unteered to try it. On raising
								the latch of the door, Bob made some noise, which awakened the old
								man, who was asleep in an adjoining room. The old man asked who it
								was, when Bob replied by mewing like a cat, which pacified the old
								man, and Bob succeeded in se curing some of the money, and retired,
								thinking he had done his share. After going back to where his
								compan- ion was waiting for him, he told him it was his turn now,
								and instructed him how to act if the old man should awake again.
								After the other thief had entered, he made some noise too, and the
								old man awoke the second time and called out, but Bob's
								companion, instead of mewing as Bob had done, replied, "It's a
								cat!" Reader imagine the Yankee Speed. -An Englishman boasting of the su periority of the

								had married badly, was about herself to take the noose. "How
								dare you get married," asked a cousin of hers, "after
								having before you the unfortunate example of your sisters?"
								"A fudge for the example of my sisters!" exclaimed the
								girl, with spirit--"I choose to make a trial myself. Did you
								ever see a parcel of pigs running to a trough of hot swill? The
								first one sticks in his nose, gets it scald- ed, and then draws back
								and squeals. The second burns his nose, and stands squealing in the
								same manner. The third follows suit, and he squeals too. But still
								it makes no difference with those behind. They never take warn- ing

								the tide of battle ran, The Night came down with flaming spear and
								shield-- Came down with starry legions marching in her van-- Came
								down and touched the rows of mangled dead, Across the knolls and by
								the little ridges lying, With loving smile, and, silent, bowed her
								head, Like some pale mourner, o'er other brave ones dying.Just on the edges of the stormy fight, As the soft night came down a
								group of soldiers knelt Around a comrade, lying calm and white, A
								stain of flowing blood upon his bayonet-belt; Close by him on the
								trampled meadow-grass, Beside his musket an unopened letter lay-- A
								message from the home which now, alas! Must be forever dark because
								of this sad day."Read to me, Corporal," he said at least-- "Read to me
								what Mary says; I shall die happier so;" Then, while across his
								face a spasm passed, He sadly moaned: "It only came to-day, you
								know; Just as I came afield 'twas given me-- I could not pause
								to read it then; but, comrades, hark! I'm going now--the long,
								dim way I see-- Read me what Mary says; 'twill cheer me in the
								dark."They read him, as he wished, the precious lines-- The words of love,
								of brave encouragement and cheer-- Read him how Mary, 'mid her
								household shrines, Was hopeful and content; how Baby, "little
								dear," Had learned to walk; how Tom had won the prize At school
								last term; how he, the dear one far away, Was prayed for nightly;
								how with straining eyes They waited his return, as for a festal
								day.They ceased. Upon the pallid, vacant face A deeper shadow fell, and
								with a weary cry The dying soldier sobbed: "Give them Thy
								grace, O blessed Father; shield them till the storm goes by!"
								His voice grew faint, then ceased--but one who bent Close to the
								fading lips heard this: "Good-night, my dears," As if with
								death's cold chill and pains were blent Sweet memories of
								home--dreams of life's brighter years.And still the battle throbbed along the hills, And still the dying
								and the dead in billows lay Along the slopes and by the crimson
								rills-- The night shades folding all in mantles dun and gray. There,
								where he fell, they scooped a shallow grave, And with her letter on
								his heart, so cald and calm, Left him to wait the roll-call of the
								brave, The summons to receive the victor's crown and palm.Taking the Oath.A gentleman informed us the other day that the following conversation
								recently took place in the office of the Provost Marshal. A well
								dressed lady entered the room and remarked: "I wish to take the
								amnesty oath." "Are you a loyal woman, madam?"
								"I suppose I am." "Are you friendly to the Southern
								Confed- eracy?" "Indeed I am." "Do you desire
								the rebels to succeed?" "I most assuredly do--I want to
								take the amnesty oath." And the oath was administered, and in
								the face of God and man this woman, to save her property we suppose,
								swore to a lie, and blackened her soul with perjury.Original.SLEEP ON, LOVED ONE.SLEEP on, thou dearly loved on, sleep; While o'er thy grave The
