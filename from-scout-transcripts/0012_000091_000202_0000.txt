But if you was to come here for a while you would see the value of it There is a great many men in our Company that cant write they have to get others to write for them if they had done as their Parents wanted them to do it is likely that they could write for themselves And all of you yet will be a great ways from your Mother and Sick among strangers and nobody to give you as much as a drink of cold water then you will say i wish i could write to my mother It is little you think of that when your mother asks you to do some little turn for her it is a great trouble to do it Now I want you to be good boys do what your Mother wants you to do help her to take care of Sharon and the Babe dont take anything that dont belong to you Be kind to your play mates and they will be kind to you Be kind to your Brothers and Little Sister I love one of you Just as much as i do the other
