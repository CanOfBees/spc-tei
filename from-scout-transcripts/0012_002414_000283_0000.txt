Late Bank of the United States October 17th 1814. Sir Although the contract between yourself on behalf of the Insurance Company of North America and the Trustees of the late Bank of the United States, dated the 17th January last, does not call for any previous notice from either party in order to make the entire loan become payable at the close of the year, I have never theless thought it expedient to acquaint you for your government, that the Board of Trustees require that the entire sum by them loaned to the said Company, say one hundred thousand dollars, together with any interest which may remain unpaid, be repaid to them on the 17th January 1815, according to the terms and provisions of the said Contract. I am very respectfully sir Your Obedient Servant D. Lenox Prest. John Inskeep Esquire President of the Insurance Company of North America
