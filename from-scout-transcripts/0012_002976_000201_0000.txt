As it is extremely awkward for any Gentleman to introduce himself, I thought I would save his Blusky by giving him a Line or two, to a few of my friends, in which character I flatter myself, I may consider you Sering to request that he may not pass unnoticed which amongst you. He has with us, the Reputation of being a spirited, well-bred Gentleman, I how what I know of him, I am satisfied you will be pleased with
