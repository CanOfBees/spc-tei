Nashville January 16th, 1905 Dear Mrs Breck: Your letter was received in due time. I hope you will give the Jackson letters to the Historical Society, and in time give also your copy of Ramsey&s Annals. We will prize the gift and thank you for it. U have delightful recollections of your honored father. I was his friend before I ever saw him, Mrs Porter's father, and uncles The " Dunlop boys" as he called them were friends of his from boyhood.

The splendid portrait of your father, painted by Branson, The Knoxville artist, was executed at my suggestion, and contributed to the Historical Society by Col. Chass McGhee. When he died, I took about a dozen members of the Society to Knoxville, we attended his funeral and witnessed the interment of his remains at his old home. I am pleased to know that you preserve interest in the Historical Society, and I hope that all of your father's descendants will maintain interest in a work so greatly honored by him. Sincerely Yours Jas. D. Porter Mrs E.A. Ramsey Breck
