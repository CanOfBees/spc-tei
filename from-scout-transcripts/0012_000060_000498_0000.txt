Previous to marking & signing my last will & testament March 25, 1882 I executed to my beloved daughter Mrs. E.A.R. Breck my promissory note for $800.00 eight hundred dollars on interest as she wanted if from time to time. This note was dated I believe in October last. Also one other note for about one hundred & ninety dollars dated I think in March last. These two notes are all the debts I know to be due from me to any one. The latter is due to the Lenoirs Manufacturing Co of the Lenoirs These two notes are bone-fide & marked & are to be paid by my executors when collections and promise payments of them, No -- reference is made to either of them in the Will But they are good & valid as already said above Witness my hand & seal June 26, 1882.
