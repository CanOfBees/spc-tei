Rome Ga April 16th 1884 Mrs. J.G.M. Ramsey, Dear Friend, The sad news of the death of your beloved husband has awakened sorrow in my household - And yet the time had come for his departure - His life work had been done - He and you had been expecting it, and loved ones on the other side of the river waiting to welcome him, have rejoiced over his interning into the heavenly rest - He was useful and honored in life and now he is lamented in death by those who still linger in the earthly homes.

Your day is far spent and your separation from him and from many friends dear to you in life and beloved of the Lord, cannot be very long - Thankful for his life and love and for the grace, which beautified his character, made him prominent among the good, and great and useful and which prepared him for a higher sphere of life, where there is neither sin, nor sickness, nor death. You must wait with patience and hope and submission to the will of God, for your own departure - under this great trial may the Spirit of grace be with you to increase your faith, and to give you peace

by enabling you to view aright the precious promises of God, to which He will no doubt direct your thoughts - With assurances of my sincere sympathy with you and your children and with my best wishes for you all, I am your sincere friend, J.M.M. Caldwell
