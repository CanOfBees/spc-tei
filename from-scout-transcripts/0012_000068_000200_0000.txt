Knoxville, Tenn, Dec. 25th 1863. My Own Darling, "A merry Christmas" to you. I arrived here safe and sound after a somewhat tedious journey both by land and water. I've had an opportunity of seeing the famous Lookout Mountain as well as the equally noted Mission Ridge. -- the former is some 2480 feet high, so you may well imagine the possibility of "fighting above the clouds." The course, or rather, route taken by me was as I predicted in a previous letter very circuitous, but it was the speediest and safest. My love to you, dearest -- hoping that the day may shed no gloom over your spirits -- oh, how I regret that I am not present with you, for any and every holiday loses its charms when absent from you. Kiss our darling little Pet for me. Commend me to mother and Fan. I would that I could add one more name, but, alas she is not here to cheer us with her merry laugh -- she has gone where there is "neither pain, nor sorrow and where all tears are wiped away." When you write address me as Dr. John Shrady, Knoxville, Tenn -- there is a Post Office here, and I can call for it. I think that there is but little doubt of my getting a Hospital appointment, -- but the facilities for treating the sick are now very poor from the fact that matters have not yet gotten into working order. Adieu, my own dear wife. God bless you is my sincerest prayer. Your absent but devoted husband John.
