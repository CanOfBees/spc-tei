coming Anna walks very well she is so sweet at least I think when they tease her or she gets into trouble she will call Ma until I answer her and then she will commence to try to tell me what is wrong it would make you laugh to hear her the boys think it fun to hear her scold them she is so earnest about it I have not been to Roberts since you went away this last time nor have they been to see me since they left I supose we are too common things now for fashions fully and I do not care a half cent they tell me that Charlie Meegan is making 125 dollars a month what if he is, do they see any comfort if they do now it is more than they are used if I am poor
