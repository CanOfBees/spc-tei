Madison, July 9th 1880. My Dear Dr. Ramsey -- I am making fair progress. Have got the assembling gather men on Watauga, Sept. 25th. 80. I have been looking for a letter you wrote me a few weeks ago abt. Parson Doak, I think, preaching a discourse to the men in camp -- & for the life of me I can't lay my hand on it. If I fail, I must put it in afterwards -- so please repeat it as you sent it to me. I wish I knew more of the route of the King's mtn. men -- it is nually, when had I thought of it, when I saw Jan Sevier in 1844, Jc. have the whole. If you know any thing besides what is

in print, please let your light shine in this dark place. Of Shelby's Officers, I am nearly ignorant -- beyond his brothers. Can you tell? Maj. Jene Walton was along -- I suppose of Sevier's men, though Josnes Sevier did not mention him. Have you any knowledge? His remaining from East Tennessee. Early after the war, probably had caused his name to be forgotten in connection with all things mtn. I have given a very full notice of Ferguson -- & something of Maj. Dunlap (who however, was not with Ferguson at Kings Mtn.) I shall give brief notices of De Peyster & some others of Ferguson's officers -- but of the Jony leaders, save a little of Col. Mills, I am ignorant. We historians have to "go it blind" oftener than we wish. God bless you! Lyman C. Draper I hope my publisher, Mr. Thomson has made an arrangement with Mr. Paulette; Mr. Charlotte com. vs, under Mr. Van Dykes lead gave my work a good commendation -- & so has your Society.
