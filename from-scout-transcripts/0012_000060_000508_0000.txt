Nashville, April 30th 1883. Mrs. Dr. Ramsey, My Dear Friend: Ever since the receipt of your letter, I have been trying to get off from my work for a few days to pay you a visit, with Judge Lea, who I know , wants to go also. But it seems that Providence rules otherwise, for the present. Judge Lea's son, Anston Lea, has recently been very sick, and he too has been with him a great deal. His interests at Memphis require his personal attention there. So, I think it more than probably that he will not be able to go

to Knoxville for some time to come. If possible, Mrs. Nelson and I will come to see you as soon as we can, to spend a day or two in Knoxville. It will be some weeks before we can come, I regret to say. We both send you a Great deal of love, and to the dear old doctor, and to all your family. We pray for you every day. Very Truly Yours, Anson Nelson Do write me a line or two, when you can, telling me how the Doctor is.
