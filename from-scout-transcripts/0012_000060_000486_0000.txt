My Kind friends -- I could not tell you on Sunday last, that probably that was my last visit, though I hoped to be able to see you once again, but have not been able to do so. I am truly sorry to write goodbye -- so much so, I would not say a word so sad, when it means any thing, & when ever I think of Knoxville, I shall recall my visits to your quiet room, as among the pleasantest hours I have spent here. May you have a comfortable & peaceful time, until we meet again -- My Son promises to go over to see you when he can, & let me hear of your daughter, & for both of my good friends. Very sincerely yours M E Huger Thursday night 23rd
