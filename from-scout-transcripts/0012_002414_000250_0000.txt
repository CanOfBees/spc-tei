Philada August 22d 1821 Dear Sir If an arrangement can be made by which you can obtain from Mr Edward Thompson his Notes endorsed by his Son, and payable in say three and four months, for the amount due to Mr Eshing at Canton, I think it is the best course that can now be taken. A judgement cannot be gained against Mr Thomson without producing the original Note to the Court. It will take at least a year to procure this Paper. By receiving the Notes with the endorsement of Mr Richard Thomson you have the additional security of another name, and in the event of any commercial embarrassment, there can be little doubt but that he would not be allowed to suffer. The only objections that occur to me are, not that the Notes taken here would carry only Pennsylvania Interest, of 8 per Cent; and 2d, that a Commission

of Bankrupcy would not bar the recovery of a debt Contracted in China, to a native of that Empire. But both these difficulties may be obviated by giving to Mr Edward Thompson a Receipt stating that the present Notes "when paid" would be a full discharge of his Note to Mr Eshing. In legal estimation, taking the new notes is not a payment of the old China debt, unless proved to have been taken as such. Such a receipt as I have recommended, would show that the intention of the parties, was not to do away the liabilityof Mr Thomson when the note drawn in China, except the notes taken here were punctually paid. If they should be protested, recourse might still be had to the original contract, and the China interest could be recovered under it. This being the case I do not hesitate to advise you as agent for Mr Eshing, to take the Notes of Mr Thompson and his son Richard at 3 and 4 Months credit even if you are obliged in order to complete such arrangement, to deduct $3 or $400_. With great Esteem your obedt Servt Benjn Tilghman Mr James Latimer _
