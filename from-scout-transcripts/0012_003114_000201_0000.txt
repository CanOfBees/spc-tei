severel wounded. The eni-mies cavelry were pro-tected by infantry and artilery
obliging men to Return to the Fort. In the evening they threw severel bombs into
some tents our center on the
other was tes A great feeling
prevails throughout camp. The boys watching the bomb as if it was some-thing beautiful to29witness At night about dark were marched to
Dover then back to a position the center. We had been allowed our position in the Fort to guard the seige guns but from the
extreme length of our Rifle pitts we I
suppose were called from the Front to assist in filling them up aganst an attack
by land It was noon8 P.M. The
enimy in hearing and our breast works to be thrown up before30day each Redgement and company were allotted there ground to propare to fight upon evry man went to work and by 4 A.M. of the 13th all was Ready for action The night was warm and pleasantFeb the 13th Morning came beautiful and fare all quietly Resting on there arms by sunrise the signal was given by two of our batterys in the center which was answered and by the time sun31was an hour high the bombs were flying spiritedly making a very noval sight in our history at
about 10 A.M. the gun boats came up and opened on the Fort and continued fireing
at intervills untill non when
they backed off having done no damage except killing Captain Dixon At 11 A.M. the enimy made an
attack on our lines just to the Right of our Redgement they charged furiously
on32our works and the leaden mesengers of death
flew thick and fast all around us but as often as they pushed on our stubern
boys drove them back with heavy loss untill they were finely Repulsed and Routed leaving many of there dead on the
field. This closed the fight of the day except fireing between the land batteries
which kept up there fire till
night In the evning it became33cloudy turned cold commenced Raining and soon in the night turned to snowing and we having to lay
on our arms in the trenches we suffered in tenslyThe night passed quietly with
occasional fireingFebruary the 14th Morning passed us all quiet and a bad loking set of fellows from the
exposure of the nightLand
batteres fireing shore to day. The enimy
seems to be trading at a dis-tant one Reg. gets orders to cook three days ations34and put up in there haversacks some sharp
shooting along our line At 1 P.M. some of the gun boats mad there apperence at the bend of
the River. They opend a furious fire on the Fort and seige battery. 
Throwing
bombs all over the Fort and out to the Rifle pits causing the boys to keep there
eys open and sometimes to hug
the ground. The fire-ing was now terifick and we began to think they were serten to leap the battery but as35they neared our battery our fire became more constant. A dence cloud of smoke arose from the
battery while peal after
peal are cleare as a
bugler blast they sending
terror and confusion on the enimys fleet at evry shot and after a fight of a
hour and a half the fleet much damage attack out of Range one of there boats sunk near the bend of the
River while all were more or less damage the news flew through our entire line and we36could here the shouts of triumph reverbiate through the hills and vallies which doubt
less went to the ears of the
enemy for they seemed infurated and soon we hear the keen crack of there cannon and the whirling of shot and
shell around us but did but
little damage.Night came on cold and dreary but still we must hug our armes and
Remain sleepless on account of the close proximity of the enimy. At about
2 A.M.37of the 15th our Reg were moved to Right wing
while some of the other forces were thrown in our formely positionFeb the 15th our Reg were placed in a
position to guard Captain Porters battery before day they Received orders to move the
battery to the left wing where they intended to attack the enemy when day came.
All things being arranged for the attack during the night ere the sunrise the ball was opened38on the left wing and soon the heavy peals of
cannon and constant roar of musk-etry was booming on our left A dense cloud of smoke arose above the timber
and settled back over the surrounding hills seven long hours the fight Raged
with dreadful carnage on both
sides The enimy constantly giving way while our boys pressed hard up on them
with shouts and yells At 11 A.M. the fireing ceaced after we had beat back[ Pages 39, 40 missing from the diary. ]41Redgements strong charged our entrenchments and our weak force overwhelmed by superior numbers were compeled to
give way which would not have been the case had General Buckners  force attack in
time to there positionFor a while great excitement prevaled among us but by
this time Porters battery is in its former position and is aping vigerously upon them moing them down at evry42peal which is constant and terifiek By the gallentry of Captain
Porter the magic like movement of our troops in Reenforcing us and the noble and
daring Generelship of our
com-mander leading our boys against them soon caused them to decline notion of
entering the Fort and fall back
the ditches well satisfied to
let the boys of Dixie alone there closed the scene except the fireing of the
sharpe43shooters which has kept up untill dark with
both armies being close to
each other with a small hill
between them a light elise on
us cool and gloomy our boys was triplin in comparison with the enemyLutenent Colonel Robb was wounded by a minie ball pasing through his
lungs and expired in about
36 hours There loss was very
heavy much by the noble work
of Captain Porter and His well direc-ted aim of our maskits our Regement was permited44to go into there quarters shortly after dark having been out during the intire seige The
night was calm and the moon shown dimly through the hazy clouds upon many pale
faces and mangled bodys lying
in the plaines of Donalson who had fallen during the day The night passed on
quietly untill about 3 A.M. of the 16th we were called up formed an marched to
Dover not knowing yet that we was surrendered but thinking45that the fight would be Renewed in the
morning on the left wing and that we were going there We Remained at Dover but a
few moments when we were faced about and marched back to the Fort and as soon as
it was light while flags were flying on the Fort We were surrendered about
midnight Generel Piller  Floyd
and Buckner  met and seeing they were sur-rounded by overwhelming numbers and the
enimy now having passefonon46of some of our works. The troops completely exhausted by loss
of sleepe unlaca by labor and
exposure by the length of serge finally con-cluded to surrender the Fort. Generel
Buckner  opened corespondence with Generel Grant while Generel Floyed and his brigade with Generel
Pillow made there escape at 4 A.M. the white flags waved over a heart stricken
people who had fought nobly and bravely for there cose but it was there painful
lot now47to surrender up there bought honors to these enimys and crouch bneath there golling yoke of oppressionFeb the 16th Found us all gloomy and depresed Reflecting partly on our condition and more
so on the condition of our beloved country. All was quiet and silent untill a peal
from the gunboats and the whishing of a shell over us broake the stillness They
fired two or three shots before they discovered the white flag after which they
came up48quietly. Severel made there escape boath offercers and privates through the lines of the enemys At 11 A.M.
the enemy entered the Fort with brass bands playing fifes screaming drums beating banners flying followed by
long columns of infantry and cavelry after which came the artilery drove into
the Fort and fired there guns in honer of there victory and planted there
banners on the Fort At 2 P.M. having stacked our arms and we were orderd49out of our cabins and were exposed to a chilling rain without any cover except our blankets untill monday [ed. note: Feb. 17, 1862] At P.M.
