Philadelphia June 17th, 1799. Sir The time for which I rented the office adjoining the insurance office from you, will expire on the 27 snst . I think the present rent of Â£50. is much too high, considering the present state of affairs, and the universal depicinution of the value of houses in the City: and as I have no doubt they will experience a further fall, I propose to you to latas the office for another year at one hundred dollars. with respect I am Sir your friend Jas. Mease J. Ball Esqr Prest. Ins. Co. N. A.
