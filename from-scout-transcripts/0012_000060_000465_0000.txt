41 North Vine Street Nashville, Tenn., April 22 1880 Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey Prest. Ten. Historical Society My Dear Sir, Mr. Nelson, who has on hand rather more than his share of business, requests me to say to you that the box of most acceptable presents had been received. We looked over the files of papers and there was nothing savoring of personality to any extent that rendered a single paper misexitable for deposit in our archives. At the meeting last night Mr. Nelson was authorized to purchase a frame with glass for the exhibition of the Franklin Constitution. The newspapers never give a full report of our proceedings. I hope you have had the health to bring your historical paper to a completion. Dr. Blacken will likely wish to give it two or three readings before its delivery to the public They have to work night and day on the Exposition Building. Flags are in great demand for public and private decoration, and excitement, though in its incipient stage is running high. I do really regret that you cannot be with us. Very Truly, Your Friend, John M. Lea
