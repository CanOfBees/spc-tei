Maryville Nov 8. 1864 >Col. O.P. Temple I have just ascertained for a certainty that M Benton Warren of this County was in the last Wheeler Raid wherein my property was destroyed by fire in this town I have further ascertained that said M B Warren holds the Title to what is earlier the old poor House Farm in this County under a Decree of the County Court made at the May Term 1862. I therefor wish you to take steps to attach property & commence suit against said M.B. Warren for the recover of the amount of my loss, which so far as I have yet been able to remember the items destroyed amounts to 1325.00 - but perhaps it will be better to put it at $1500.00.. If you will send down a Bond Tmle deen it of security - &Respectfully Thos Sanderson
