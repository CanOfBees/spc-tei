Department of State Oct. 13, 1795. Sir I have just received from Mr. Ades the following answer to my letter of yesterday written in consequence of your information of a report current in the city that the French Government had given orders to take neutral vessels bound to the ports of the enemies of France. " I have no knowledge that my Government have given orders to seize neutral vessels laden for the ports of the powers who are enemies of France. My last dispatches, which are of a recent date, make no mention of it. " So doubtless the report was raised for sinister purposes. I am sir yr. obt. Servt. Timothy Pickering Mr. Robert Ralston.
