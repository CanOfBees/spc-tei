On account of Pa's sickness, none of us could be with her but I think she died easy. We were at the funeral today, it was preached at home & she was buried at Hopewell church. She looked very much like she did when alive. Uncle Dave asked me to write to-night so you all could hear sooner.

Iffr Arr who preached the funeral had to preach one for three other people. That will show you something of the amount of sickness around here. I will close hoping to hear from you soon & sympathising with you. Your affectionate niece, Annette Ramsey Monday eve,
