Louisville, Ky. Aug. 25/83. Dr. J.G.M. Ramsay, Knoxville, Tenn: Dear Sir: I have just read of your being prostrated twelve years, your being aged and infirm, a relic of the past, and the most valued historian of the State.

Louisville, Ky. Sec. State: Dear Sir: Please give me the names of the Governors of your State -- and acting ones -- from the first one to the present, giving the name, if you can, of the party that elected each. Please give me the name and address of a lineal descendant of each Gov. who is dead, and the address of each Ex-Gov. I am writing to all the Secretaries; intend to compile a Biographical Dictionary of the Governors of the States, giving a brief sketch of each. Have had some experience; hope to, in a couple of year,s produce a useful volume. Please give me the names of two men, old citizens, who are posted in the history of your State, with whom to correspond. Yours truly A.S.
