Knoxville Tennessee Dec 22ond/63 My darling Sarah Your letter of the 13th of last month, I am very happy to say arrived to day with its contents all right. and I sit down this evening to write you a few lines to send by one of our men that is going to start for home in the morning. he goes to Kentucky on business and from there he is going home to spend part of the Holy days anyway. oh darling how glad I am that your letter at last came through, but the most of all that your picture is safe. I am a thousand times obliged to you for it Sarah. and in return I send you mine. as soon as I heard he was going I went down town and got a couple taken and the best one I send to you. I got it taken this afternoon, and if you can get it all right I shall be well paid. your picture suits me very well. if anything it looks as though you had been sick, but I am satisfied with it. Sarah I will write to you oftener. I will write to you again next sunday and every Sunday after unless something prevents. it is almost dark now so I will have to stop. so darling here is a good night to you and my love as true as ever. John
