Swan-pond March 25th 1813 My dearly beloved, and now my oldest Son, Sixteen years ago this day, I first seen your face, on that day, and on many days since I endeavoured to give you to God, I almost dayly and hourly feel anxiety of mind about your happiness in this life and in the life that is to come, you have now arrived at a very critical period of your life, a time when the mind is very often formed as to the future character, the dispositions and habits formed about your present age, and a few years after are such as is generally seen to accompany thro the whole course of life afterwards, If this be true, then of what vast importance is it to set out right - Oh my son if you knew, or could recognize how much my happiness, as well as your own depends on your good conduct, I am sure you would still continue to try to add to my happiness, by guarding against youthful follies, and now when you are coming near to mans years strive to "put away childish things" "My Son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine; yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things." Prov. XXIII - 15.16 "I have no greater Joy than to hear that my children walk in Truth" 3rd Epistle of John 4th verse You will be careful to take all opportunities of storing your mind with useful and ornamental knowledge nad such books as may be of most advantage to you in this respect, and for this purpose I herewith

Send you Beatties Elements - which if I am not mistaken is elegantly written, (but of this I am not a competent Judge) - I think it would be advisable for you to make a small blank book in which you should write down your own observations on every author you read, particularly noting the section page &c - and if in any thing you are at loss to understand your author - particularly note that, and write it down by way of interrogation, and take some occasional opportunity of proposing it to your Uncle, or to any person whom you think would be able to give you light on the subject - cultivate a disposition to reflect on, and apply all you read, this is the way to make your reading profitable to you, and your life a pleasure to your-self and to those connected with you - There is one thing my dear Son I think it my Duty to advise you about and to caution you respecting, it is this - young men of ingenuous minds, and of a Friendly disposition, in the ardor of their Friendship sometimes unintentionally injure the feelings or character of one Friend or associate in the mind of another Friend or associate - I will give you an example - suppose I have two Friends A. and B - with whom I am intimate - and they are unacquainted with each other - My Friend A. in the confidence of his Friendship with me, does some act before me, or says something to me, that he would not wish to be known by any body else - I afterwards in the confidence of my Friendship with B tell him

about my Friend A. not intending any injury to A by telling B - yet you see at once that A is thereby lessened in the eyes of B altho I have told nothing but what was true and in the ardor of my Friendship for B - and at the same time not intending to act unfriendly to my Friend A. - this is an evil that frequently arises among young Friends who are communicative, and the more Friends or associates we have we are in the more danger of falling into this snare and still doing it in the exercise of a Friendly disposition, I am the most particular in mentioning this as it is an error I have seen very many fall into, that they were not aware of it - because they were unconscious of a design to injure any Friend, and as it only injures by consequence and not of design. My Dear Son I am anxious that you should excel in every thing that is praise worthy, and ornamental to the human character - you are naturally an Example to your dear little Brother Billy whose naturally placid, and yielding disposition you may be very helpful to lead in the paths of Virtue, Sobriety and Piety - this letter I design for you both but it was suggested principally from the circumstance of this being your birthday - Let me exhort you in the words of an apostle "The youthful lusts which war against the Soul" "Let none despise thy youth, but be (both of you) an example to others" " Abstain from an appearance of evil" "Pray without ceasing" I shall conclude with the words of Solomon "My Sons, hear the instructions of a Father," that you both may be disposed to walk in the Fear and Love of God, and to seek him now in the days of your youth is the Earnest and constant prayer of my dear sons your affectionate Father F.A. Ramsey To J.G.My & W.B.A. Ramsey
