To Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey, on His 87th Birthday. Like Xenophon, the great Athenian, thou To me most semest in thy lengthened years; Him History's Muse counts one of thy compeers And worthy prototypes; and on thy brow The same as his, Fame's wreath doth well allow; His sad life-story, ere its closing, wears The exile's doom; but free from harms and fears, Thy country clasps thee to her bosom now. Long mayst thou linger in earth's realms below To bless who love thee with thy noble voice - With thy grand wods, their hearts to animate And point through Virtue's pathway where to go; And when HEaven's King shall call thee, full of joys One brief glad step of thine shall find the Gate! W.G. McAdoo University of Tennessee, Knoxville, March 25, 1884.
