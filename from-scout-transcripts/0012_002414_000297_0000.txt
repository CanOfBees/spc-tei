New York 22nd Jany 1806 Sir I received your favour of the 6th inst together with the letters of M Lyste Esqr relative to the property which fell into the hands of William McNamarow. The interval between the date of your instructions and this letter has been employed in making the necessary inquiries which terminated in the certainty that some money had been paid to Gouverneur &Kemble agrieably to the supposition of M Lyste. I then applied directly to Messrs Gouverneur &Kemble who acknowledged that in the month of Decr last they received one thousand dollars in a bill which they collected and transmitted to him immediately. They add that they have had several applications relative to this money and I find they have given the same answer. In this state of things I should doubt the prudence of any further pursuit as I fear it would only be productive of expence. Should the letters of M Lyste be considered of importance to the office I will forward them as directed. I am with great respect Your Obt Servt Washington Morton C. Pettit Esqr
