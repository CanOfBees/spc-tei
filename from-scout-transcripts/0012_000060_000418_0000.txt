41 North Vine St. Nashville, May 6 1874 Dr. J. G. M. Ramsey, Dear Sir, I send to you by this mail the Republican Banner, containing a copy of the proceedings of the last Meeting of the Tenn essee Historical Society. Dr. Foster and myself request you to prepare the circular to be addressed to the people of the State soliciting the contribution of historic relics.

The Address may and, perhaps, should be brief, and, as you could so much better express the objects in view, we trust it is not asking too much of you to discharge the duty. We all hope it may suit your convenience to provide at some of our regular meetings. Considerable interest on the subject is being awakened, and it is anticipated, that good results will follow from the re- organization of our society. Very respectfully, John M. Lea.
