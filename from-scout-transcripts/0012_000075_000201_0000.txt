Camp at the foot of Clinch Mountain Dec 20th 1863 Dear Father, I received your letter of the 20th some two or three days ago but untill this morning I could not find time to answer it. In my last I beleif we were under marching orders. Well that same day our Brigade was ordered to the Front, being placed on the extreme left to hold the Gap between Clinc and House mountains This is about sixteen miles north of Knoxville and about two from Strawberry Plains, at which place the main body of our army is encamped. On our front we have thrown up Brest Works but I think they will be of little use to us, for I dont think Longstreet will risk another fight Yesterday heavy firing was heard on our Right. I have first heard that it

was our Cavalry fighting at New Market. That place is nine miles north of the Plains and directly in our Front. The Cavalry report the main body of Longstreet men as leaving, moving in the direction of North Carolina. They still tell us that our Division is to return to Chattanooga. For my part I dont care how soon we start for I am getting tired of this place. I havent seen a paper since leaving Chattanooga. They are doing all they can to get our regiment in the Veteran Corps. Gov Tod has written to Major Stafford saying that he wishes to keep up the old organization. But I am afraid they will hardly succeed. The Boys say that the Veteran Corps is played out. I am still enjoying good health weigh more now than I ever did before. I am now staying at the House of a Rebel Lieutenant, guarding the property. We had a splendid Christmas Dinner yesterday. But I will have to close. There is no talk of a forward move. Give my love to ma and all the rest. And write soon Yours Affectionately Will PS Direct letters to Chattanooga
