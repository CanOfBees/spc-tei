Dr. Wills of Atlanta Ga. has been formally invited to deliver an address at the raising of a Monument to my Father. We have not yet setled on a day for the address to be delivered, but suppose it will be sometime in November, I have been able to collect the greater part of the dates &c, mentioned in your letter, but have not all. The dates of his ordination & vice-presidency at Wash. Col. are not found

I am greatly obliged to you for the interest you take in his memory, and trust you may be able to forward to Dr. Wills at Atlanta Ga. many facts that will illustrate his character. I have not at present full lists of the Trustees of Tusculum Col. This college has been lately united by an act of our Legilature , with Greeneville college. The Institution in its present form goes under the style of Greeneville & Tusculum College. I enclose a list of those present acting as Trustees of the Consolidated Institution.
