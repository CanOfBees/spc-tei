HQ Mis 4 Div Cav All Huntsville All Aug 10th 1864 Hon O.P. Temple Knoxville Tenn Sir I have recently received several letters from friends at home, stating that there was a desire among some of the loyal men to see me occupying the place of Attor Genl in our circuit. Untill the courts are properly reestablished I prefer to remain in the army - nor would I be willing to resign until the end is soon. If it was not for a hurt I received by the fall of a horse, in a fight with Morgan in 62, which recently gives me some trouble - Will you make some inquiry in regard to who the loyal men of that circuit is likely to have for circuit judge

and will probably aspire to the Attor Gen'l place? I am not very anxious to try to fill a place that I am so little prepared to fill properly Yet I would like to call those men who have murdered robbed, driven from home and insulted and oppressed our unprotected families; to account for some of their just actions - and to watch their future movements - Some of this must be done by us before the courts are established, while other cases ought be examined only by the courts - Genl Gillem is on his way now with one brigade of E Ten Cav (Millers) to clean up Guerrillus (Confidential) I regret that I was not permitted to go - I am now in command of the 4th Cav Div but hope I will not have the responsibility long - Write me how things look for reorganizing the courts in our circuit. I am very respectfully Your civil Servant J M Thornburgh
