Sir, I am really sorry that my apparent neglect of your Intimation to take up the several policies, should have excited your Censure &I should still more regret if I were the cause of any blame attaching to you. I scarcely know what apology to make, unless I say that my frequent absence from the city &an unusual hurry of business, have prevented me __ I however am obliged to you for the Letter just received, tho the Rebuke contained in it be rather severe. I will thank you for my amount, &on Monday, the business shall be closed. I am with Respect your illegible M. Wharton decr. 27. 1800.
