Dear Sir. I have had the honor to receive your letter, of the 23d. of April, on the subject of Messs. Donath &Cos. claim against Don Alvarez Calderon of this island. It would give me much pleasure to be able to transmit a satisfactory reply to this flattering mark of your &their confidence ; by promising a more successful result to their application, than present circumstances warrant me to expect. By this opportunity I have informed those Gentlemen that the elevated situation of Dn. Alvarez, precludes every other than the most leneint measures in their affair : And to your good-self, Sir. I must add, that I have reasons for having less confidence in the "Honor of a Spanish Gentleman" that you appear disposed to indulge. I shall however take those steps which, upon further deliberation may appear best, &inform Messs. Donath of whatever may be finally adopted. With the highest respect &regard I am, Sir, Your Obed. Servt. Jno. Morton Havana, 12. June 1800. C. Pettit Esqr
