Knoxville T Jan 12/71 Dr J.G. M Ramsey Dr J - I returned home last week - I did not see my prospect for business in that city - It required too much cash capital for me to go into my sort of business. The U.S. Court is in session now and John is very much engaged and I have not met with McCormick I will try & see him to day and if I can get any information that will give me a hope of making a compromise with Brownlow if all your cases , I will try to go to Washington City - Mr Spence who promised to aid me in the matter is now in Washington & will remain there during the winter. I will write him to day. In the mean time write me whatever you think would give my aid in the matter. John showed me your letter authorizing the dismissal of the suit sui The Traders Bank & myself. I am very much in hopes we can have them dismissal at the next term of the Court. I have not heard what was done with your Brakebill matter. I very

much hope that the money can be realized without my suit. I am afraid my Coations in East Tennessee will not be satisfactory and that I shall have to bemore or at least remain away myself and try and get into business somewhere. I wrote you at one time about my misunderstanding with Cre Deaderick . I can see very plainly a great castnop on the part of the most of the family in annyance of this and it makes the place rather unpleasant. We will move to the place purchased by Darthura & Margaret next week. It is 4 miles from town on the Clinton RR - contains 80 acres The boys still continue to have chills - Dunlap had one last night William has not had any for two weeks Love to all Yours truly A. C. Crozier
