" THE WATER THAT I SHALL GIVE "Far beyond the storm and tempest,
               That untroubled calm above,-
               There the Son of God abideth,
               Resting in the Father's love.Loved with love beyond all measure,
               Love that knows no check or shade;
               Loved before the worlds were founded,
               Loved before the heavens were made.Loved with all the love that dwelleth
               In the very heart of God;
               Loved with all the love befitting
               Him in whom all grace abode.Loved with all the love He claimeth,
               Who endured the cross and shame,
               The forsaking of his Father,
               To exalt the Father's name.There in that unmingled gladness,
               That unmeasured endless peace,
               He abideth and rejoiceth
               With a joy that cannot cease.And amidst that joy and glory,
               In that peace no tongue can tell,
               Far above the storm and tempest,
               There on high with Him we dwell.All that precious love our portion,
               Sharing all alike with Him;
               All our thirst for ever quenching
               In that everlasting stream.Ever in the Father's bosom,
               There forever come what may;
               For the love that sought and found us,
               Keepeth us by night and day.Precious to that tender Father,
               Precious to that gracious Son;
               Precious to that Holy Spirit,
               By whom He and we are one.Unto this His life has brought us,
               Nothing less than this He gives;
               This the secret joy and power,
               Of the heart wherein He lives.Let us praise that love forever,
               Fall in worship at His feet;
               Lost in silent joy and wonder,
               Sinners made in Him complete.J. A. Whipple,   Hamilton Place, Boston, U. S.
