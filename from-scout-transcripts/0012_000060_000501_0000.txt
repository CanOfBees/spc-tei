Sonnet. To Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey. Sunday, Sept. 24. 1882. O, Friend of my young years, and all my years From youth to gray-haired age! How glad my heart That yet I see thee here, and that Death's dark The fated stroke to thee -- to both -- forbears! I am like courser fleeter that noon nears The destined goal, though later was my start; And no, co-equal, we approach the mark Where we shall barter this poor vale of Tears For that eternal kingdom where decay And pain, and sorrow, enter nevermore! So, hand in hand, let us in joy descend The verdant shore of age, and find our way Across death's darksome streak unto the shore Where Life, and youth, and bliss shall never end! W.G. McAdoo. Home, Knoxville
