Mrs Indiana Freeman. In accordance with the rules of our association. The painful duty of communicating to you, the death of your husband {J. O. Freeman} devolves on us. He fell in the late engagement with the enemy at Chickamauga , whilst nobly defending the rights of his country, this to you is indeed a Sad calamity, for which we deeply Sympathize with you. We are happy to inform you that he professed religion during the late revival of religion near Chattanooga and since that time his deportment has been such as always characterises a true christian. We feel Satisfied that our loss is his eternal gain, for "Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord". Respectfully D. G. Godwin Vice President S. C. A. 51st & 52nd Ten Regs A.R. Hill Secty
