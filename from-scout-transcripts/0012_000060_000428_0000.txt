Madison, Aug. 3d 1875. My Dear Dr. Ramsey-- I have one point I wish to have your opinion on -- in common with others --- it is To what extent did the early Presbyterians of the South make use of Saturday as a preparation day for Sunday -- whether merely in temporal matters, or whether this day was in whole a part used as a religious preparation, by meeting with or without a pastor? I don't see anything in Foote & other Presbyterian writers on this point. My associate, Mr. Butterfield, takes hold finely -- & we are digging away on our first

book -- on Border Forays & Adventures, simply first, because the book we said it wd. pay best, & we needed something for bread and butter. In haste-- Truly Yours, Lyman C. Draper I am sorry to hear of Ex-President Johnson's death. I once spent a pleasant hour with him. He was thoroughly honest --- that goes a great ways in these, or indeed any times. Rev. Dr. Park Help me to answer this letter of Hon. L. C. Draper. I did not know before that Presbyterians ever used Saturday as in preparation for the Sabbath -- on the other hand in the olden times when the communion was to be administered, four days were devoted to that service but Friday was then observed as a Fast days & was oficially observed as preparatory to the sacredness of a communion occasion -- Am I correct in this? & was this the unmonied of bon whole church or only of North Carolina & Tennessee Presbyterians? Please return this letter & your observations on the subject matter of it. J. G. M. Ramsey
