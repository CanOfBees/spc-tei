River-Side March 3, 1872, My Dear Children We recd. late last night Liddys letter of the 27.th. Feb. & are very glad to hear that all in town & country are well- & especially that Sue is again up & very well with the little folks. It is very fortunate that she has had such good nurses. Against this reaches you, you will have received your Mas letter telling you that it had been decided on that we would go to town & occupy either the house in East Knoxville or one of four we have been looking at over on the other end of town. In some respects Liddys house & garden Vineyard Orchard stable & cow-house suit us better than some of the others without any or few of these appendages It is almost as near to the Church & as accessible to my customers but the others are in better neighborhoods & the rents comparatively higher. I & the rest wish Liddy was here to help us choose the location. Where we are there is too few rooms & the social advantages as to society are not so good as town. Tho the weather has been too inclement even in Knoxville to allow of much society. Which do you think Liddy will be best-this side of the Creek or West of Gay street? Dr. Frank talks of leaving & his house will be for rent. But it is under the hill & badly arranged for every thing but contiguity to the spring. MKnitt went to look through your house last week & describes it as more convenient & fashionable than I thought it. I wish you were here to form an opinion

about the selection . Your Ma wrote you to have every thing of ours that is portable & that is worth its freight, carefully packed & boxed up & marked carefully J.G.M. Ramsey Knoxville Tennessee Care of J. M. Walley Gay Street Take R.R. receipts & say on the boxes Via Augusta Atlanta & Dalton. Tell Robt. & W. Alexander to sell off for cash such things as are unsold & will not bear carriage . The stove is one of these & it ought to bring nearly cost. Let them give you the pro ceeds of the articles sold. If that is not enough to bring you home in April write to me & I will send you more. If the things can be packed up, boxed & properly directed it may be as well done at once. We cant move till they arrive. After the 20th. of March will be as soon as the weather will be warm enough for us to change our bed rooms Neither of us is quite as well as we have been We had Friday night another very heavy snow storm-7 or 8 inches deep & the roads are terrible Last night your Ma had a very bad spell but has been up all day tho she is now in bed a little earlier than usual. All winter she seemed quite well & I hope will continue so I was called to Lenoirs last week to see Louise Ramsey - I left her a little better. Every thing down there is greatly improved - every thing clean , quiet & orderly. No noise wrangling - children well dressd & well behaved & the gentlemen all friendly & even respectful & deferential. I never saw such a change. A.R.C. has returned from Texas & perhaps will reman in Tenn. Mrs. Keller is said to be worse. We want to go down there before long. J. W .C. & family & all other friends are well. This will reach you in Charlotte I expect & is directed there. Kiss Ardie for us & when you go out to Alexandriana Kiss Bartie Ramsey & the babe for your Ma & me. When the things are sold write how much money you have & how much you will need. Affectionately J.G.M. Ramsey. The following text is a continuation of the second page of the letter. Remember us to Rev. Dr. Miller & family & such other friends in town as recollect or inquire for us & Dr. Henderson & Rev. Mr. Williams both of whom have written to me. Also Dr. Wilson & Squire Kearns & other friends. The preceding text is a continuation of the second page of the letter.
