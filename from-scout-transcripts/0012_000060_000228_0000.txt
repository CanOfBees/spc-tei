My dear Daughter, your Pa has written so fully on every subject there is buy little for me to say. Sophia Alexander was married last wednesday morning to Dr Lamples an old flame he is 57 - she is 30 they left immediately for Memphis where he resides a number of the clan were present most of whom it is said were not invited - none of our set were invited but Capt Johnson & Mr Holliday, not even Davidson A., of course they are teased by the rest, especially by the ladies. Lue. & Mc were at Ms H. the evening before Old Ms H. is there, she begged them to stay all night, & she would have an opposition breakfast. When the throng of wash is over I will go up to Roberts he will send his buggy for me, it will be a long ride for me, if I am well can go, last week I was not well. Write often and tell us all the news of Tenn. I am very uneasy about Crozier. I received a letter last week from Nannie, they were all well and seem much pleased with their new home. Give my love to your Aunt Mary tell her when she moves again had better come to N.C. your aff Ma M.B. Ramsey
