Sewanee. Easter Sunday. Tennessee April 9th My Dear Mrs. Ramsay My Son forwarded me your kind invitation for the Drs birthday -- which made me regret still more, that I was obligated to leave Knoxville so soon -- I wrote to you through the mail the day before I left, telling you why I had not said good bye, the last evening I was at your house, when I took a cup of Coffee with the Dr. I hoped then to be able to spend another afternoon with you & it gave me pain to say good bye. I fully intended to write last week but have been so much occupied since my return, have not had a quiet hour. In the last fortnight, I have established my self, with my two daughters, & little Esther, in a Cottage, next door to my daughter Mrs Elliott. We had every thing to arrange in the house, & a great deal outside of it.

and at the same time had to organize our school -- have the school house made clean & put in order, refrain fence - & C, & commenced last Monday with Eleven pupils -- three more come tomorrow, & I think we have the prospect of a successful school. My eldest Son promised to give his Sister a piano, & when that comes, they will have several music pupils, so we feel we have much to be thankful for, in a comfortable peaceful home, where we can live together in independence. The girls are quite delighted -- Being blan children, & recollecting nothing of times of more worldly prosperity, they enjoy their own home, & I doubt if the Vanderbuilts & Goulds are as contented & merry. I find vegetation much behind Knoxville, the trees, except fruit, & some early ones, still look as bare & black as mid winter.

There are no vegetables to be had, & all the provisions dearer, than I have ever known them -- beef as high as 12 1/2 -- Chicken, 25 butter 25 & corn & meal 1,25 -- though I have known it as cheap as 40 -- & the usual price is from 60 to 70 cts per bushel. The school -- University has opened well as usual I think -- between 1 & 2 hundred Students -- Only those, who have homes here, are duties, are yet on the Mountain, but the hot months, will bring many visitors, & pupils to us too, I expect. I often think of the pleasant visits to you & the Dr. the only social intercourse I had in Knoxville, & truly hope shall meet you both next Autumn --. My Son & his wife are going to Norfolk soon to the wedding of my nephew Thomas Pinckney , but I hope they will find time to make you a visit occasionally. Remember me most kindly to the Dr & your daughter & Believe me yours truly M E Huger
