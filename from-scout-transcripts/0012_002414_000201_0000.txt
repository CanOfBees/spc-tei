Washington January 18, 1804 Sir When Mr Barry affected insurance on my five houses in this place, at your office on the 4th of March last, he informed me on his return, that had it been known that the roofs had been seperated by fire walls, thirty dollars less would have been taken. The fact is, that each house is speerated by fire walls the usual hight above the roofs, & as I wish to insure again on the fourth of March, I presume the $30 will be allowed in the next years premium, if so, you will be pleased to inform me, & in due time I will forward on the balkinty a post note, I wish to be informed whether a new policy is necessary, & also whether in the course of the year there is any objection to the erection of back buildings of brick, for the accomodation of the houses insured, the houses intended, are for kitches, the accomodation of the families of each house. Your answer will oblige. Sir Your noble serv Danl. Carroll of Delw NB. There has been no house built near the houses insured since the alst description, and but one on the square, that a brick stable, removed from the houses, farther than the one described.
