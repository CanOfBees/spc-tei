New York, 30 Septem., 1879 Dear Sir: In reply to your esteemed favor of the 27th inst. we beg to say, that, while we think favorably of the work you offer -- Annals of Tennessee, by Dr. Ramsey, for use in schools -- we cannot give you a positive answer without some further particulars. Be so kind as to let us know how large a book it will be, what grade of pupils it would aim to reach, and what maps or illustrations will be needed. After hearing from you again more fully we shall be able to decide. Meanwhile, as always, we remain, You respectfully: D. Appleton & Co. D. Anson Nelson, Esq., Nashville, Tenn.
