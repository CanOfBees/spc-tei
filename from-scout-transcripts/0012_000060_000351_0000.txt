The following post script runs along the left side of the first page of the letter. P.S. By a letter received yesterday from Old Uncle Alexander I am informed that Aunt is no better but is wore very low by her sickness of more than twelve months, it is probable that she will soon take her flight also and light in the Realms of Glory and ever be with her Lord, whom she hath loved so long and so faithfully upon earth. The preceding post script runs along the left side of the first page of the letter. Swan-pond September 25th 1800 Honored Parents I do not know what to say, what to think or what to conclude about my receiving no accounts from you, more than twelve months have elapsed since I have received a scrape of a pen from you, this is my seventh letter in that time, why it is that no account is received by either my Brother or my self from you is therefore matter of surprize indeed: Brother received yours of the 15th of March last by post in a very short time after it was wrote which made us expect to receive more shortly in the same way - My last to you was dated 30th of July last, on that same day I was seized with the remitting Fever and for the most part have been confined to the house (tho not to bed) ever since - a few days after I was taken, our son Samuel Reynolds was taken a few days after him James was taken, and after him McKnitt - The Children all soon recovered - Mrs Ramsey alone of the white family escaped, and five of the Black have had it, and all appear tolerably well recovered, and we was hoping that Providence who had thus far tryed us would stay his hand and not contend longer with us - but Oh! how blasted our expectations! Not to keep you longer in suspence about the mournful event! Our Dear Son Samuel Reynolds is now in Eternity. Gods Holy Will be done -- The manner of his death was as follows (to wit) on the morning of the 16th instant him and his two Brothers John and James had all arose early in apparent good health as ever they were - each one of them took a piece of bread and ate heartily after they got up and were all playing about the outside of the yard when I arose -

at about 8 oclock they all came into the House Sammy complained to his Ma that he was cold, he sat before her a short time at the fire and began to shake we put him into bed and covered him warm expecting he was taking a fit of the ague, but he was directly seized with some kind of stupor and sleepiness and could scare talk any - he then was taken with a violent vomiting and purging which continued about an hour, and then ceased, he had a most excessive thirst from the first which continued with him while he could take any thing when the vomiting ceased he broke out in a cold clammy sweat which continued to the last he was at this time for the most part delirious and could talk until about 12 oclock at which time he became conuntsed & continued from one fit to another until about 3 o clock at which time his breath left him, and his active sprightly spirit I humbly trust was graciously received in the arms of our blessed Redeemer, who in the days of his flesh took little Children into his arms and blessed them - and said of such is the kingdom of God! Immediately after Sammy was taken and began to appear sleepy we suspected the symptoms were dangerous and sent off for Mr Garreck (who is now in the practice of Physic) he was not at home, the messenger continued on to town for Doctor Claiborn who was not at home neither, but was then about two miles from my own house - I sent there for him and it was about 12 oclock before we

we could get any medical assistance, every effort proved fruitless after the Doctor came as well as before, God was determined to show us that in this as well as other things that "without him we could do nothing" he I fondly hope took him to himself - about 10 oclock Sammy in the midst of his distraction and great pain broke out and sung "Salvation oh! the joyful sound "Tis pleasure to our ears - who can say but that at that very moment the spirit of God was showing him that of creation and making ling to accept it - I humbly trust that him and his Brother who went before him are now in the enjoyment of God and have already learned more about that salvation that is purchased by our glorious Redeemer than what is known by the most advanced Saint on earth - My Brother is sick also and was not able to come to see us, and assist us in this trying time it appears as if God had on purpose us out from human comfort that we aforetime enjoyed that he himself might be seen to be the only source from whence we derive consolation, and bless his name that he with-holds not altogether own free favour from us, and hath positively promised that his loving kindness he will not take away; - My dear old Aunt Patton hath also took her flight from these regions of distress - upon the 9th day of August she sent over to see if I could go over and see her I then had a fever upon me and could not go, when she heard I could not come, then believing the time of her departure was at hand she cried out "Good Lord Jesus receive my Spirit," she spoke none afterwards but in about fifteen minutes went asleep we trust in Jesus and I expect will awake in his Image in the morning of the Resurrection, and Oh! that we may all be prepared to rise The following text is a continuation of the fourth page of the letter. in like manner is the earnest prayer of your affectionate son F.A. Ramsey P.S. I hope Brother is on the recovery , Mrs Ramsey desires to be remembered to you all, she is unable to write at present. The preceding text is a continuation of the fourth page of the letter.
