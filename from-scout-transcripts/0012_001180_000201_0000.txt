American Hotel Easton Pa Sep 25.66 Dear Father Amid the noisey and Babel of confusion I will write brifly a few lines tonight not having the necessary advantages for writing a long one. Yesterday and today I have been busy getting my specimens and circulars ready. I am now ready to commence tomorrow morning and if I dont create a "furow" among the Fair people it will not be my fault. We have some of the finest specimens I ever saw, sent on from NY this morn I wish you could see them. I will distribute 10,000 circulars by Friday I telegraphed to Kimberly at Phily this afternoon for newboys and they have just arrived. Tomorrow I begin nisk in earnest. I want to get through here that I can attend Chester Co Fair on Sat. This Fair is said to exced anything of the kind ever held in the State Everything is well represented. our Cell stands far ahead of all the rest in display of Penmanship. Several Cillegs intended entering but when they found me there they kept back. There is a very large Democratic meeting here tonight only a few doors from the Hotel. Yours truly H.B. Wetzell
