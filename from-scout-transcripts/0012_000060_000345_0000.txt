Dear James I had written the enclosed letters to you with an expectation of sending them by Mr Patterson but he was gone before I got to Mr Rogerses with the letter, I have since that time received some specie and have sent $20 by levy . I wish you to go on Saturday to Mr Carmichaels, and try if he will give you any money, whatever he will give you either in paper or silver will be acceptable. I want you to come by Squire Galbraiths and bring the Merino wool that I left there cancled if it is done if it is not I suppose can be done while you are there -- If Mr Harneses buys does not wait until Monday I would rather you would not start with them, as for you to travel on the Sableath , you can perhaps be ready on Saturday night, and come down after Tensncess as far as Squire Galbraiths, breakfast at Greeneville on Monday morning and get home on Tuesday night - but prudence will doust - May God have you continually in his Holy keeping is the earnest Prayer of your affectionate Father - F.A. Ramsey 27th September 1815 Our kind Salutations to all Friends I wish you to see Mr Carmichael
