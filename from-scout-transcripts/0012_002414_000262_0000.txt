Feby.. 21st.. 1797 Sir, My public duties confine me so closely to the House of Representatives from the hour of ten to that of three every day, except sunday, that I have it not in my power to call at the office within those hours which I understand to be also yours for transacting business. Will you be so obliging therefore as to communicate to me by letter the decision of the Board upon the subject of my letter of friday last in relation to the Insurance of my dwelling house against fire ? My lodgings are at No..41 in Arch street, a few doors below second. I am sir 1 1/4 JCn. Your very hum. servt.. Jona: Dayton Ebenezer Hazard Esqr..
