Charles Pettit Esqr Baltimore June 25th 1804 Sir I have lately Received two letters, Addressed to me as Secretary of the Marine Insurance Office, from Mr James Johnston of New york, on the Subject of an Insurance, Effected on Cargo of Ship Sally, from Charleston to Havana, taken and Condemd in New providence, in the first he States, a desire to become the Agent of the Underwriters, to Endeavor by Compromise, to Get Something from the Captors, or to purchase the Claim, and Attempt A Recovery on account of his House. _ In Answer to this, I was Instructed to Inform him, that the Marine Office would Abandon their Right to him, for $3000, having Insured On Said Cargo to Ammount of $1000_0 and if this proposition was Not Acceded to by him, I Requested to know, the terms on which he Would Undertake the Agency, in behalf of the Assuner , his Reply was Received the 23d, in which he States that the only terms, on which he will purchase, is to pay the Expenses that has, Arrisen or may Arrise, in pursueing the Appeal, when if he Succeeds the ammount is for his Use, or he will Agree to become the Agent of the Assuner , Charging a Commission of five perCent on the Ammount he may Recover_ this last proposition Appears most Agreeable to the Marine Office, as the Expense of the Appeal Cannot be very Considerable, and from the favourable
