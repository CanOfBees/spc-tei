Philada Feb 15, 1803 Sir We are just favored with your Note of Yesterday requesting to be informed of the Usage of our Office respecting Insurance on valued policies on Goods, valued by the Shipper at the Port of "Shipment "_ In reply illegible state that Instances of this sort have frequently occured _ and where the Underwriters consented or made objection to the Valuation at the Time of signing the Policy, it has always been considered as binding; unless it should afterwards appear that the Valuation greatly exceeded the Property on board, including Prev. Toll Charges.__ In some Cases Insurances have been made on specific Articles (including as well Foreign, as American Produce) at a Stipulated Valuation in the Policy; &in others on Goods generally valued at a certain Sum, without further Explanation at the Time_&without any difference from the usual premium. We do not recollect an Instance when payment has been refused in case of Loss over that the Valuation Should have exceeded the Lost Charges & Pre to cover by 10 p Cent._ We are very respectfully Your obt Servt Wharton &Lewis illegible Chas. Pettit Esqr Presdt. Inse. Co. No. Aa.
