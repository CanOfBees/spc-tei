Mar. 27 1890 Huntersville N.C. Dear Aunt Lizzie We received a note from Uncle Mack last night which says for me to acknowledge the thankful receipt of in his name. He is not able to write any at all or even to sit up. The money certainly came in a time when it was much needed as the support of the whole family since xmas has fallen an Bud and you know he is small yet and can not get a mans wager working. This year is the last I expect to attend school for some time, I must now see if I cannot turn what I have learned into something to help Pa with. Grace A__ was taken home yesterday very sick, she has had the chills this week. The teachers gave their monthly lecture monday night

in the hall and it was rather cool, Grace was there and probably that was what made her sick, as she had a chill the next morning. Grandma Atwells have been sick, Andie stayed up there a good while, until Pa got sick. I do not know what is the matter with him, the "afr" does not say but I think it is fever. You must excuse this short letter for I am very tired, have written four pages of foolscap. You know we always have compositions friday and Thursday is my day to write mine. Andie is copying hers now and using the best pen so I am writing with a scratchy one. We all, not only Pa, thank you for sending the money and it way be in our power someday to pay you but if not you will have your reward in heaven. I will close now as it is near train time and I wish to mail it tonight. Your loving niece, Annette Ramsey
