Memphis, Jany 28th 1877 Dr J.G.M. Ramsey My Dear Sir Your letter of the 22nd just was forwarded to me by your young friend Dr Cornick. In response to which I can only say that it will afford me pleasure to aid him in his application to the extent of my ability -- and I desire to say further that I shall be obliged to you and other democratic friends in East Tennessee to keep me advised as to what is right and proper to be done from time to time in the matter of East Tennessee appointments, and with regard to East Tennessee affairs generally -- as I am resolved that no injustice shall be done to that section of the state -- I hope to be able to do full and strict justice to all sections, but if I err at all in this respect, the error shall be in aid of our friends in East Tennessee. Pardon brevity, I write in great haste Very Truly your friend Isham G. Harris
