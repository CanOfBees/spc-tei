Nashville, May 7th 1877. Dr. J.G.M.Ramsey President Hist. Soc. of Tenn. My Dear Sir: Our annual meeting, on Tuesday last, was tolerably well attended, and all the old officers were re-elected, separately, to some for another year. A large number of donations were announced, and I put myself to a good deal of trouble to make out a full report for the American, which they did not publish, only inserting a notice of about thirty or forty lines. Their manner of cutting up our proceedings, of late, is not pleasant. The afternoon paper, "The Banner," published several items about the meeting, but all in a disjoined way. We tried to get an appropriation from the State at the last session, and Dr. Lindsley and myself went before a committee to explain our necessities, and the reasons

for asking State wid. The committee listened to us very respectfully, and reported a bill to give us $500 a year for two years, which subsequently passed the Senate, but failed in the House for want of attention. I imagine the members were not disposed to aid anything, for their policy seemed to be to pull down and destroy, instead of to build up the interests of the State. A worse Legislature I never saw assembled here; and I sincerely hope Gov. Porter will not call them together again for any purpose. I think their coming together again would be a calamity. Our Society is getting along very well, and we hope to make a good deal of progress this year. The unanimity of your election as President, was very gratifying. We meet again on the first Tuesday in July. With many kind wishes, and with the sincere regards of my wife and myself to you and Mrs. Ramsey, I remain yours, Very respectfully, Anson Nelson
