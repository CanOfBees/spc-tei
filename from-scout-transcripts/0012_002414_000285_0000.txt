Department of State 12 June 1804 Sir I duly received your letter of the 2nd. inst. and in answer have to inform you, that Several months ago instructions were forwarded to our Minister at Paris with a view to procure the consent of the French Government to such a modification of the Convention of April 1803 as may produce a more equal distribution of the 20 million of lives among the claimants whose interest was saved in the Convention of Octr. 1800, than might be the operation of the former Convention. I am, sir, very respect fully Your most obed. servt. James Madison Charles Pettit Esqr. Philadelphia
