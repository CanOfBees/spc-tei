Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey, Knoxville, Tenn. Dear Sir: Your box of valuables came safely to hand yesterday and Judge Lea happened to come into my office soon after it was received. I sent the box to his house, and we examined the articles during the afternoon and night, and found them to be what you represent them -- very valuable indeed. The "Franklin" paper, especially, is of the utmost importance, and will be kept with scrupulous care. It is now, with some other papers you sent, in a "combination safe," which make the articles secure from fire and burglars. I have so much to do, that I can only thank you for the box of articles, and let you know of their safe arrival. We all would be glad
