Madison, Apr. 22nd 1876. My Dear Doctor Ramsey -- I think of you often -- but write seldom. Have a selfish inquiry to make -- though I may have heretofore made it: About a Col. Elijah Isaacs, who figured prominently in Burke Co. N.C. during & after the Revolution -- & finally floated off West -- I suppose to Tennessee. I wish to learn about him. Have you any knowledge or tradition of such a man? He was an active officer in the Revn., & much in the N.C. legislature -- & wd. be a man of some mark wherever he went, I wd. suppose. I wrote the late Gov. Graham,

but he knew nothing of him. In writing a few days ago abt. Gen. Evan Shelby, I notice Haywood & you both state he was made a Brig. Genl. by Virginia: Col. Todd (son-in-law of Jc Shelby -- in his Shelby memoir on the Portrail Gallery days after the Va. & N.C. boundary line was extended in 1779-80, Evan Shelby was forced to reside in N.C., & was then made Brig. Gen. -- Evidently by Gov. Nash of N.C., & hence, I infer, Jc. Shelby in Same County, was advanced to Colonel. See if you can trip up this way of putting the matter. My Mecklenburg is packed on the shelf -- can't get a publisher to take hold of it on his risk; & I hesitate to involve myself in getting before the public, as such monographs are not likely to attract only a select attention. God bless you! Ever Truly Yours, Lyman C. Draper. Do you know any of the name of Isaacs in Tenn? Jaeb. B. Isaacs, M.C., was a Pennsylvanian -- & so wd. not do. Your Judge Heiskell might know.
