Alexandriana Dec 29 1828 Dr Sir Having nothing particular to communicate, I write to reciprocate that friendship manifested by your letter from Charleston, - no occurences worthy of notice since you left us - have received no letter from Tennessee - We hope to hear from you frequently - & always of your increasing health & enjoyments - in your present situation you perhaps owe a duty to your Country which your talents enables you to perform , - in a cool dispationate way, to allay the unreasonable & unpatriotic fervour in So. C. - a, - arriving from misconception as to the nature & opperation of the tariff - A tariff is operative as a source of revenue to a certain entent - every tariff laid by Congress has opperated as a of productive revenue without intranein price of fabricks or &c prices of agricultural products - a less importation of one article - leading to a more extensive importation of others will ever be the result of mercantile speculation & policy, the tariff is thus clearly a revenue law so far as yet developed, not in the least effecting the shippers or farmer, & if its operation thus continues, it must be constitutional, - according to their own principles - a modification in thus only proper.

C.a. as it has ever been - always on the highest extremes - apathy or irritability prodigality - penury - wisdom - folly - perfect despondency as in a Revolution. - or the morbid vigour & energy of a Maniac, as now - May health - prosperity, & happiness accompany you J.M.
