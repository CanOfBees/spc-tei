Gentlemen. Mr Davy has applied to me, on behalf of Mrss: Mlloney & Durand, to recover the amount of the insurance on the Cargo of the Schooner Starte. As the question of respecting the loss in this case has been compromised at the other insurance office, and as Mrss: Mallaby & Durand are disposed, either to make the same compromise with you, or to refer the controversy to the decision of impartial arbitrators (agreebly to the terms of the Policy) I hope you will render it unnecessary to involve you in the expense and trouble of a law suit. I am the more anxious for an amicable adjustment, as it is obivious, that the interests of the Company will be materially affected, on the appeal to the English Admirality, by the ground which will be take to support the Plaintiff's demand. I beg the favor of an early answer; & am your most obedient servent, A. L. Dallas Phil: 12 March 1798 To The President & Directors of the Ins. Comp; of N. A.
