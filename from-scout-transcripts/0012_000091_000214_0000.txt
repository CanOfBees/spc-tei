they are all well I suppose you fellows had great rejoicing over the capture of Jeff Davis I should like to see him with petticoats one if they hang him which they ought to do they ought to dress him in womans clothes I hope the north will have the right kind of rejoicing over such victories and not again worship the creature more than the Creator as has always been done heretofore I dont hardly supose that you will get back before some time in June if as sorrow as that Dear pass dont be vexed at the brevity of this letter for I am tired and sleepy and I thought I must write to you and you would be uneasy about the children the weatha he is changable Davy dont kill yourself laughin over the blunders I made last night for I fell asleep two or three times before I quit writing I was so tired dont think hard of the shortness of this letter I will do better next time but I thought you would be looking for word from home Yours Anna
