Norris Master Insured on the 6th Instant at your Office, returned to this port on the day before yesterday /Sunday/ after being Several days at Sea__ under protest of the Mate of Seamen privately agreed upon without the Consent or knowledge of Capt.

the Captain proceeding, he privately bored a hole with a three quarter Auger thro the bottom of the Vessel and she made considerable water through it so that it was but with constant labour with our pump they could keep her free. It therefore remains with the assurers to say whether the Cargo shall be discharged here or not to examine if there are any damaged goods on board &if yes to say what shall be done with them __ For our parts believing as we do that very little water has been in her at any our time &knowing that the goods on the Ground Lecn are nails Only __ we believe the damage if any must be very trifling and not worth while discharging the Vessel for ___ The Vessel has not been distressed _ did not leak except while the whole bored by the mate remained Open neither was any thing carried away or lost and the Cause of returning appears to be a nefarious Scheme of the Mates _ who run off as soon as he could steal himself on shore & has not been since found not withstanding there has been three Civil Officers After him these two days. Captn Norris in consequence of three days
