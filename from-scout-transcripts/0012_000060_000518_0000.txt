Madison, Oct. 11th, 1883 Mrs. Dr. Ramsey -- My Kind Friend -- I have kindly to thank you for your favor of the 6th irest. I feel like troubling yet a little further on the matter of Boone's camp -- inasmuch as the old people residing in that neighborhood are ignorant of its locality. I beg Dr. Ramsey will indicate, as nearly as he can -- in which direction from the Boone tree - & abt. The distance - -was the camp? If near Boone's Creek, to the South of the tree some distance; or little Sinking Creek, to the north, ' pretty nearby. I rather suspect it was South-East of the tree,

& near Boone's Creek. I would be glad of the photograph of the Boone tree, as the Doctor has a couple of them. God Kindly bless you both! Cordially & Truly Yours, Lyman C. Draper.
