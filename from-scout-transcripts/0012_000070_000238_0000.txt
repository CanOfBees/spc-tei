Newport. March 3, 1862 Colo: OP: Temmple Dear Sir Upon consultation with Messers Swan & Fletcher, I have determined not to hold the Chancery Court at Sevierville, on the third Monday of this month, but have appointed a special Term, to commence on Wednesday after the 5th Monday of March. That just preceeds the regular term of the circuit court under the recent act, making two terms. I think this will accommodate all parties- I have written to the clerk on the subject, I directed him to inform the parties as far as possible- If all the rumours we here to day are true, it not likely there will any thing done at any court for some time- It is reported here that the federal pickets are approaching Clinton but I have little faith in the news- Some 8 or 10 wagons are hauling bacon from to & I suppose there is some alarm at that place- Please inform Mr Washlums & Fleming of the change. Your friend S.I.W. Lucky
