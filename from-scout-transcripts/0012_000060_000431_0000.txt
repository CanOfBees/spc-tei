Blount from the aspersions of Judge Gayarre; before it reached me, I had received from Mr Itting Secretary of the Committee on the restoration of Independence Hall, a formal application to me to furnish a sketch of the life of Govr. Blount, to be read at Philadelphia on the 2nd of July next, and with your consent, I propose to furnish in your name, the paper now in my possession; it will then be published in

book form, with sketches of all the delegates to the Convention that formed The Federal Constitution; its publication now named excluded it from the book referred to, as name but sketches prepared exclusively for it will appear, if this is agreeable to you, I will have the paper carefully copied, and will file the original with the Historical Society. I did not receive the copies of the "Age" referred to in your letter, I would be pleased to see the articles mentioned. Very Truly Yours. Jas. D. Porter.
