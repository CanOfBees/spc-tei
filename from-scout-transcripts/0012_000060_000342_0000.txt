Franklin May 6th 1822 Dr Ramsey Sir Bugg has paid into my hands three hundred and sixty dollars to be applied on your note - He says he will pay the ballance when the note is sent on - You had better send his note to me and I will send you the money you can draw on me immediately for the $360 - Old Stephens is as great a rascal as ever - I regret extremely that I was ordered to discontinue against him, as a Mr Castirs has since obtained a judgment against him and collected some hundred dollars, notwithstanding the old villain's attempts to put his property into the hands of his son, who is a chip &c I issued a writ of ejectment against him as you ordered, but he could not be found - I will catch him though, and will finally oust him, but I fear will never get much money from him. I dare say he could pay in counterfeit money - He is a grand villain. About a year since I went into Maury County and found Alexander - He is, as they say here, mighty good for nothing - no chance of ever getting anything - He denied the account too - Yrs &c C.G. Olmsted
