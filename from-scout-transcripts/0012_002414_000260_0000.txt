Feby. 22d 1797. Sir, Your note of yesterday communicating the decision of the Committee on behalf of the Insurance Compy. of North America has been received. My intention was to have insured to the amount of five thousand Dollars upon my dwelling house for which it was not expected that even so much as one per cent. would have been demanded. I will however agree to give one per Cent. for one year to commence with this day or the morrow. It is proper to inform you that there have been neither any attempts nor alarms of fire in Elizabeth town within a fortnight, &that I had determined long since to remove the barn & other buildings near the Eastern wing at least forty feet farther from the house. This removal I will stipulate to make in or before the month of May, if the Board shall close with the terms now offered. I am sir Your very hum. servt. Jona: Dayton Ebenezer Hazard Esqr.
