Philad: Apr 13. 1798 Sir, I attended a Meeting of the Owners of and Shippers on Board ye Pegou last Evening and found that Intelligence had been received that the Pegou had been taken by a French privateer and afterwards retaken by a British Cruiser and carried to Antigua ___ As a great part of the Cargo might be consumed by a Sale for the Salvage it was thought prudent to purchase a Schooner or other small Vessel and send her immediately to Antigua in order to obtain Security there for the Salvage to the Re Captors and thereby preventing a Sale of the Property and ordering the Pegou to the Port of Philadelphia possibly with Convoy and in fine empowering the Owners of the Pegou to do the best they can for the general Interest. I thought it necessary however to acquaint you who are my Underwriter with these Circumstances and to learn whether you approve of the Measures proposed to be adopted __ Your answer will oblige Your obt Hble Servt. EdwBurd To Joseph Ball Esqr. President of the Insurance Company of North America
