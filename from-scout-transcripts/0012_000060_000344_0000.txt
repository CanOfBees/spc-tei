Verses Composed by a Youth in Memory of his Mother Kind was thy soul, &c. Knox County, September 16, 1819

Elegy composed by a youth in Memory of his Mother Kind was thy soul with every virtue blest, My earliest friend, to mem'ry ever dear, Still is thy goodness on my mind imprest, And oft remembered with a falling tear. Thy arms my helpless infancy sustained, Thy pity listen'd to my plaintive cries And when of thirst or hunger I complain'd I always found thy hand had rich supplies. Oft did my head upon thy bosom rest, Quiet, content, and free from every care; Oft did I fly to thy maternal breast, To tell my joys or pour sorrows there. Still anxious to improve my rising youth, Thy pious care, and never-ceasing love Taught me the ways of Equity and Truth, And often rais'd my thoughts to things above. Alas! the scene is chang'd those days are o'er Those happy days of innocence and peace: Thy friendly cheering voice is heard no more To share my joys or bid my sorrows cease. Still can I see thee as thou wast in death, Thy soul with heav'n and happiness in view; Smiling look, & up , and to thy friends beneath In feeble accents bide thy last adieu. May I prepare for that approaching day When I must all my worldly joys resign; When Death shall call my trembling soul away, Oh may my latest moments be like thine.
