Madison, Sept. 1st 1880. My Dear Dr. Ramsey -- Only a single inquiry this time: Can you recall your authority for stating that the Kings Mtn. men camped the first night at Talbot's Mill? Not that you think you must have had good authority for saying so -- no doubt of that; but whether you know your man, & whether he was one of 'Enr? It seems a short move from Sycamore Shoals -- some 3 miles -- hardly worth the effort. There is one thing certain -- they made no two nights camp west of the Mountain. It was either

as you say at Talbots -- or as WB carter writers some 20 odd miles from Sycamore at Crab Orchard. If at Talbots, then their next day's march was a long one -- for they went a little down the Eastern declivity of Yellow Mtn. In haste -- Truly Yours, Lyman C. Draper. I see the Kings Mtn. Comtee. have invited Hoges & his Cabinet, you & I to share in the Centennial celebration. I would like to be there on many accounts; but I cannot go -- must keep pegging away at home. L.C.D.
