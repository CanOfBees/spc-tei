Madison, Aug. 12nd 1880. My Dear Dr. Ramsey -- Your favor of the 6th is at hand. I fear it would not be safe to infer that there was much of a part of Tennesseeans at the Cowpens. None of the printed accounts -- Judge Johnson, nor Graham's life of Morgan -- nor the unreliable acct. of Dr. S. L. Hammond in Johnson's Tradns. of the Revn., make any mention of Tennesseeans being there. Evan Shelby Jr., what I wrote you was there -- (on Geo. Wilson's authority, I think, I wrote you --see my letter of 2nd Aug to be certain) was the brother of Gc. & Moses Shelby -- & as Evan was a Major at King's Mountain,

as the docs. in Shelby & PReston controvesy show -- & Moses then a Captain, so it would hardly do to make the latter the Senior. So if there was any command -- I doubt it -- Evan had the Seniority. In the accounts of the Cowpens, even Capt. Tate's command of Virginians is mentioned -- so, I think, if there had been any think like a company of Tennesseeans, they wd. have been mentioned somewhere. The little party of four -- with the possibility of a few associates, could only have been volunteers on their own look -- & not enough of them to get any special notice. They, however, deserved it, for the distance they came. Pray, don't make too many of them. Very Truly Yours, Lyman C. Draper. You once wrote, in the goodness of your hears, for some data of my life. A friend & neighbor, Prof. R.B. Anderson, of the State University & distinguished as the writer on Norwegian literature has just written a sketch of me: But it may be sometime before it is in print.
