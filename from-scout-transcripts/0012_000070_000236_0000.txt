(Private) Chattanooga, Tenn Jan 11th '62 Col O.P. Temple: Dear Sir, I will pass through Knoxville one day next week, probably Tuesday or Wednesday, & would be pleased to hear from Col Baxter by that time in relation to his Printing Office. I address you because I understand him to be an intimate friend of yours, & because my personal acquaintance with Col B is more limited than with yourself. I am anxious to locate in Knoxville, because, in the first place, it is near my mothers family, now rendered lonely by the volunteering of my younger brother, & because it is in a vicinity where I am extensively acquainted. In the next place, I have chosen the editorial profession for life, & consider Knoxville a favorable point to build up a good newspaper. May I, therefore, ask your influence on my behalf with Col Baxter? Two other positions of a similar character have been offered me: one in this state, the other in Augusta Ga: I prefer Knoxville to either, & am only waiting on Col B. for a specific answer. Convinced as I am that Chattanooga will never be able to sustain a first class Daily Press, I have fully determined to sever my connection with the business in this place. Mr Hill has joined the army, & should I come to Knoxville, think it more than probable there would be no paper published here, or I would bring most of the G & A patronage with me -- owing to my indisposition during the present week, Mr Hill has been writing for the paper, which is his first labor in our columns for months past. In the hope of hearing from you soon I remain ys truly &c. Wm L. Scruggs
