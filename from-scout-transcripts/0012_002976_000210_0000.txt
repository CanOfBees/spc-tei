Treasury Department Comptroller's Office Jany 30th. 1792 Sir I have examined the papers which you left in my hands relative to the accounts of Anthony Walton White , and find, that his claims have been the subject of a report of the Secretary of War, to the House of Representatives of the United States. If I rightly understand the nature of Mr. White's claims, they can only be adjusted in consequence of explanations to be received from himself. I shall therefore preserve the papers on file in this office, until Mr. White shall call for a settlement. I have the honour to be with great respect, Sir, Your obedt. Servt. Oliv. Wolcott The Honourable Egbert Benson Esquire
