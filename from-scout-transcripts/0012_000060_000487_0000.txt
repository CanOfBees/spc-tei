To Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey, On reaching his 85th Birthday, March 25th 1882. O joy, that to the pyramid of years Which in Thy Life thy loving friends behold, One more is added; and to thee unrolled Thy life's year Eight-sixth in joy appears! Already Tennessee's great heart reveres Thy honored name, as did the Greeks of old The grand Thucydides; for Thou has told The story of Thy land's proud pioneers! He did the same for Greece; and as his name Through the years by Thousands lives, so too Thine own Shall Through the future ages oft be cited. Heaven send thee many years! And may the claim Fate hath on all, so gently be made known That Thou shall painless pass to Heaven delighted! W.G. McAdoo Knoxville, Tennessee.
