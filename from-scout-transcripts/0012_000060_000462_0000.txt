Madison, Apl. 14th, 1880. My Dear Dr. Ramsey -- I thankfully reed. your obliging letters -- & also one from Mr. Paulette. I have not yet written to Mr. P., as I am waiting for a better understanding with intended publishers. I have no do doubt I shall succeed with my Cincinnati friend, & get him to venture its publication -- & in good style, too-- & especially if the preliminary commendations of the work can be secured -- which I hope with your aid & that of other friends, can be effected. As one of the Tenn. communications & with whom I formerly corresponded, I have just written to Hon. J.N. Van Dyke, at Athens --

suggesting that he see or correspond with you as to the propriety of submitting some compensatory resolution at the Charlotte conference in June. So you will see what I have done -- & why I have done it. I have commenced on the work -- & must say I find my materials even more complete than I had expected -- they are all that could be desired. But they ought to have been very full, as the result of forty years faithful gathering. I sent you the first copy of our new Vol. of Collections I got hold of -- & trust it will safely reach you, & afford you some satisfaction. Mr. Paulette will hear from me in due time. God bless you! Truly yours, Lyman C. Draper.
