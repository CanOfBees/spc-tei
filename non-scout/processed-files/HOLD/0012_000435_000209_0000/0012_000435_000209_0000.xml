            <p>My Dear Father</p>
            <p>We arrived here safely last Saturday, the morning after we left Memphis. Found all well at Aunt <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">Coffees</unclear>, They were all very glad to see us. We are enjoying ourselves very much. Sister R talks some of staying all the summer, she is so much pleased with her misit, and as for me, I am much better than when I left Memphis, indded I feel almost well and myself again. I ought to have written to you before. We are very anxious to hear how your health is, and that you have entirely recovered; also anxious to hear what news brother John brings from your place. I hope he brings favorable news. Write to me on receipt of this. Please send</p>

            <p>my letters <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">to</unclear> here until Sunday night, after that Keep them in Memphis until you hear from me. I shall leave here Monday or Tuesday, but know not yet whether I shall go by Nashville or not. I will write you again as too that.</p>
            <p>Daniel is well and enjoying the country very much; he and Andrew Hutchins are constantly on the go.</p>
