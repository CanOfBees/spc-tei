        <p>Dear Ellen:</p>
        <p>This is some rainy day here so will write to you. I am feeling fine and hope you are in the best of health. We havent had any mail for most two weeks  I dont know what is the matter</p>
        <p>I am real anxious to here from some one back home. Some one sent Jno<unclear reason="illegible" resp="PW">rtmell</unclear>two Jaxan Suns and a Memphis paper so we have been reading the news for the last two days</p>
        <p>This afternoon we were on our bunks reading. So I got sleepy and went to sleep. just got up in time for supper we have supper at 530 PM and then it is a long time until dark.</p>
        <p>It doesnt get dark until about 9 oclock. We moved again yesterday but just a short ways. </p>
        <p>We are in a larger town now but a little nearer the front. Well I am in a different job now. I am helping</p>
        <pb n="3" facs="0012_001303_000223_0003.jpg" xml:id="d4e76"/>
        <p>on a army truck Jno Cortmell and I are together Dont get excited the ink is out of my <unclear reason="illegible" resp="PW">hin</unclear>and there isnt any more around. </p>
        <p>Say we have a town clock here that stacks just like your little clock on the hand 10-30 and 45 minuts so I told Jno I was going to have it stoped cause it reminded me of you just to murch.</p>
        <p>and I am to far away from there to thank of that time ever fifteen minuts.</p>
        <p>I dont have to have a clock to remind of you for I thank of you many times ever day and how much I would like to see you.</p>
        <p>Now just think if I was at home tonight we could go to the show cause I dont believe it is raining there.</p>
        <p>Well I dont know any thing else to write this time. Will do better next time write me when you can and tell me all the news with lots of love</p>
