            <p>Memphis, Mar. 6th 1865</p>
            <p>My Darling</p>
            <p>Yours of last week recd on Saturday I am sorry that you are so unwell but hope you will be well <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">as</unclear> this reaches you.  I am again in the same business that I was and hope to be able to make money tolerably fast.  Genl Orme has taken the duties of the whole upon himself and I am now acting under him he seems to be willing to do all he can for me. and I am glad I am at work under him. I thank Charlie for her willingness to do as I wish and if she thinks when examinations approaches that she cannot pass She may not be examined</p>

            <p>but I hope she may be able to graduate, I will send you money as you want it but think that it will be best to put all I can get into Bonds paying 7,36 percent than to pay the Express rates in sending it to you. and when I come to you or you to me you can then take it without the expense I hope to be with you before the first of April if I cannot you must come down and see me, for I long for you and time increases instead of diminishes my longing. The work I have been doing for the past two weeks was very laborious keeping <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">me very</unclear> fit and fatigued <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">so much</unclear> I have the promise of an overcoat for our Boy from the same man who gave him the suit I will get it in a few days. </p>

            <p>I have got another big trunk like the one I took him last summer and a fine leather valise, long enough for me to travel with, worth $20- both given to me.  I am writing this in my office and it is now near mail time cannot write more Love and Kisses to all</p>
