            <p> As I write twice a week and there is nothing of interest to you in this place you will have to be contented with short letters The result of last weeks <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">fees</unclear> are $136, besides my daily pay. expenses for board lodging office rent and blanks about $20, so one weeks fees pays your expenses for a month but it is very tiresome in the long evenings and I daily wish for your company, we have had one hard front which makes the leaves fall <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">fastly</unclear> no vegetables but sweet potatoes and I am afraid to eat them tho I feel very well again and using only cistern water hope to keep all right, I hope to hear from <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">Tommy</unclear> this week and hope to get somewhere where there is Lots of Cotton for I do want to get him once more. I hope you are all comfortable and pleased with your mode of living and that you have recd the money I desired Athearn to send you from Memphis and that the muffs arrived safe - I expect to get some other skins in a few days those I expected were not brought in kiss the children for me </p>
