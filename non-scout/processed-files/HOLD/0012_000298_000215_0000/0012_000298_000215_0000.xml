            <p>Yours of the 20th recd Saturday. I am glad that Charlie is willing to go back to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">Shayer</unclear> it is the best I can do for her at present and she learns with such ease it would be a pity if she should not Graduate afterward she can direct her <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">attention most</unclear> particularly to any branch she may fancy<unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">n be deficient it</unclear> I hope Harriet is better I am uneasy about her. and would like to consult Dr. Pulte if I could.

I wish I had a sufficiency of it or even of Green backs to buy a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">house S c_</unclear>but am truly thankful for what I do got I could not write yesterday the servant not having cleaned out the office and <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">made</unclear>fire.
