            <p>my full allowance, I am sorry that Ann is leaving you try and get some one that can do the hard work as I do not like you having to do it - I am eating at a tavern Mrs Cox <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">him mond</unclear> too far from my office for me to eat with him - Mr Buna wishes you to come down and spend some time at his house he has a very comfortable place he built for himself before the war but I do not see how you can leave the children. I would be delighted if it could be down as I want to see you so much - take care of my boy and do not let him be exposed and call in the doctor in time if any of you are sick</p>
            <p>God bless you all.</p>
            <p>Your aff husband</p>
