            <p>Memphis July 16th 1869</p>
            <p> Dear Elizabeth</p>
            <p>I go down to the plantation this evening, and it will depend on the state of affairs there how long I will stay.</p>
            <p>I rode out to our place here this morning, and gave notice that we wanted the premises as soon as they could be vacated. Miss Moon said that they were looking for other quarters, but would be glad to remain until octr. The administrator Mr Galbreath is not yet prepared to settle her accounts. </p>
            <p>Eliza is desirous of going with you to the plantation. She says that Sylvia is on her hands and will die from starvation if not relieved.</p>
            <p>If <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">Elleck</unclear> gets his money tell him to let Marten have the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">rise</unclear> of it in <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">settling</unclear> with the hands. I will replace it in a week or so.  Memphis is the hottest place in the world. The convention  here for encouraging the importation of Chinese laborers <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">adjourned yesterday.</unclear>
            </p>
            <p>when you or any of the children write to me let the letter come to the care of Boyd J Marten Memphis. They will forward to me at the plantation.</p>
            <p>With prayers for your health &amp; happiness</p>
            <p>remain Yrs aff </p>
