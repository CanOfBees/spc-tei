            <p>I am here after 2 days <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">hard colley</unclear> in the stage and will be off in the morning to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">Cincinnilte</unclear>; by Cleaveland &amp;New <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">York</unclear> &amp; Washington</p>
            <p>I asked John Martin to help me get <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">lead</unclear> of line, who is a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">disavantage</unclear> to our children.

You must meet your share of the difficulty with your whole fortitude. In a short time I shall <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">understand</unclear> my ground, and the moment I see that the profits of the enterprise will <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">authorize</unclear> me to take a house at Washington, I shall come on for you. Let my letters be sent on to Washington and particularly the quarterly of the French reviews forwarded to me <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">by my con Jackson. If Otter</unclear> come from</p>
