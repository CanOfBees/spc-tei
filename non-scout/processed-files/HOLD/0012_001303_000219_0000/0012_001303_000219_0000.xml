        <p>Some where in France</p>
        <p>Dear Ellen</p>
        <p>Once more I'll write you with out recieving a letter from you. I would give anything to get some mail, but have give up all hopes
 I had a letter from Mother last week is the only letter I have recieved in a month</p>
        <p>I dont blame the people back home  for I know you all wrote me. But the mail service is awful here. Now when I do get my mail ill get a big bunch at once.
And they will be about two months old. We we first got here we had good service would get mail every week.</p>
        <p>This leave me all old and hope you are fine and dandy/ I am still working real hard every day. But it is nice and cool and I know you are about to burn up back in Tennessee.</p>
        <p>The mornings are all cold when we get up I wear a thick shirt a wool sweater and a suit of overalls and never get to warm. How do you think you would like that.</p>
        <pb n="3" facs="0012_001303_000219_0003.jpg" xml:id="d4e71"/>
        <p>I am in the mountains though is why it is so cold. Sure hope i leave here before winter comes if I dont I see myself freezing to death.
Well wht do you think of the paper news now ? looks good to me.</p>
        <p>I hope they can keep it and i might eat christmas dinner in Berlin. Wouldnt that be nice? I saw some boys I know from home last sunday
Max Harper from Jackson and some boys from Cairo Ill. They worked for the I. C. Road.</p>
        <p>They have been here a year but have just come where I am so I had to go see them they have gone now though so guess I wont see them again.
Max Harper worked for them and I guess you didnt know him. Jm Cartmell got a letter from his brother Hugh you know him dont you? He is over here some where. I think
all of the first boys to leave Jackson are over here now sure wish I could find them. But may go all the way through and never see any of them.</p>
        <pb n="4" facs="0012_001303_000219_0004.jpg" xml:id="d4e79"/>
        <p>Say you know I never did write Ester and her mom I lost the address before I had time to write I remember Pratt City was ther any more to it.</p>
        <p>Has Ester been back to Jackson since she married? I bet she has</p>
        <p>How is Aunt Annie getting along. Oh how I would like to be at 307 Johnson St. this PM. You know I could play in my back yard. ha ha
But I dont think such a thing will happen any wheres soon.</p>
        <p>Say do you get my letters? I wrote you every week. I hope you get mine more regular than I get yours. 
Well Dear I know some more I could write but most not so write me real often and tell me all the news and dont forget</p>
