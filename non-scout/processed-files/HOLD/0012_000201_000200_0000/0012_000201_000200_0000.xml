            <p>Dec. 21st A.D. 1863.</p>
            <p>Dear Mother:-</p>
            <p>After several days of real cold winter weather like the birds we are made
                    cheerful with the return of a warm and pleasant day. My &apos;ink&apos; yesterday was in a
                    frozen state, &amp; I like the ink was too cold to write. I have several
                    letters to answer, as we have had but little time, &amp; poor chance to
                    write frequently. We have been marching, &amp; in &quot;line of battle&quot; sometimes
                    day, &amp; night. As yet we have not engaged the enemy, though some of our
                    Brigade did at Kingston 24th Nov. We formed a line of Skirmishess on the extreme
                    left. I got a letter from Charlie 14th Inst &amp; four more on 16th. One
                    from C.C. One for Carr-one from C.J. &amp; one from M. Stiles. Morts letter
                    was dated Folly Island S. C. Nov. 21st. He was well. Cynthia was going to
                    school. I regret to learn of the death of Wm. Stephenson. We must soon cross the
                    same stream.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_000201_000200_0003.jpg" xml:id="d4e116"/>
            <p>We received some pay last saturday.</p>
            <p>We got 4 months wages, &amp; settled last years clothing bill. There was 4.75
                    coming to me out of the 42 dollars appropriated to that purpose. I got 56.75. I
                    send 40 dollars to you by State Agent. The receipt I send in this letter. It
                    explains itself. I lent 20 dollars to a comrade in battle. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="lr">Int. 6 percent.</unclear> I have some 13
                    dollars yet. I should have sent the twenty but he desired it &amp; is
                    honest. I have two pair of shoes now &amp; two pair socks. The mittens I
                    brought from home are as good as new. Id sew another good seat coat - have two
                    old shirts, &amp; one new one. Many are worce off than I. The prospect of
                    sending clothing, &amp; c I should think is rather dark. I should not desire
                    you to think of it. Rations are scarce. I hear them call out &quot;a load of hard
                    tack.&quot; We have had no bread since yesterday noon. I dined last night on a tuncup
                    of coffee, &amp; a lump of lard. I slept well over it, &amp; am well
                    this morning.</p>
            <p>Yours Affectionately, P.S.S. Scott.</p>
