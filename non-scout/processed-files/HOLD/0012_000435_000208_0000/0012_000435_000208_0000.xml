            <p>I am at the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">landruy</unclear> to day for the meat which was shipped by the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">Touward</unclear>, and not delivered on her downward trip. The negroes are all well, and will finish the cotton this week, except a few acres that are covered with water from the late season rains. There will be about 120 bales, The new overseer makes a good beginning and I hope will continue to do well.  He has no family, and, if free from the vice of drinking cannot fail to make a good crop. Becca is spinning up the wool to make socks.</p>
            <p>They are at work on the levy, and my creek will not disturb me any more, as soon as the levy is finished. As soon as I can ship my cotton I will do to New Orleans, but will be at home in about 2 or three weeks. I have not time to say more but will write again in a few days.</p>
