        <p>Dear Ellen:</p>
        <p>Will write you a few lines this afternoon even if I am so busy. I have had enough inspections
for the last three days to get ten men out of the army. I am glad to say I have about finished them here though.
We are expecting to leave here tomorow for Brest I guess we will have some more 2. Lieut. to deal with when we get there.
But the worst of it is over and I am not at all sorry</p>
        <pb n="3" facs="0012_001303_000251_0003.jpg" xml:id="d4e67"/>
        <p>I dont know just how long we will be at Brest I dont think will be long I am going to try to get home by the 4th of July
If we dont have to stay in Brest to long I think well make it OK</p>
        <p>Now if I do get there by that time you will have to take me out and show me the sights for I am sure I wont know how to act
I wont try to tell you much about this place until I get home But will say it is an awful place, ask Lynn</p>
        <pb n="4" facs="0012_001303_000251_0004.jpg" xml:id="d4e73"/>
        <p>We thought we were going to leave here to day but something happened I dont know what. 
We'll quit for this time will write you from Brest if we stay there very long. If not we'll let you know when I get in the U. S. 
Hopeing to see you real soon with lots of love. </p>
        <p>James L.</p>
