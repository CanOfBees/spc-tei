            <p>Concordia Oct 17th 1857 </p>
            <p> Dear Elizabeth</p>
            <p>I wrote you a short note by <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">way</unclear> Bother John who left me on the 13th. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">Linee then the</unclear>negroes have improved a little, but <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">they take fresh</unclear> chills nearly as fast as I send them to the field. I am here to day for quinine, but find none in the country. Those that I had in the field this week average more than 100 lb to the hand, but there are always some 15 or 20 not engaged as pickers. My corn is gathered and in a fine crop. The cotton will yield near a bale to the acre if it can be saved.</p>
            <p>I will be at home as soon as I put things in a proper train - will start the gin tomorrow, and hope the negroes will improve as soon as we get a frost. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">Eony</unclear>, the overseer appears to have managed very well for the last month.</p>
            <p>There are no dangerous cases, unless they become so from relapses. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="EMS">Shack</unclear> is near the worst case, and I think his has been produced by too much quinine.</p>
            <p>See that the wheat is measured as it is sown, and that the corn is given freely to the hogs. </p>
            <p>Yr aff </p>
            <p>AJ Donelson</p>
