            <p>My Darling</p>
            <p>Judge Barnity has had to go to N Orleans and I will have to remain here until his return. the latter part of next week I had hoped to be with you before that time but I can not get off I shall have to go to Helena again this week to attend to the sale of a wharf boat. the distance is but 90 miles and I will be absent only part of two days. Charlottes letter asking to come down has been rcd but she could not get down before I shall have to leave this place. we have had it very cold for two days Ice being formed on the plank sidewalks and I suppose all the fruit killed the peach trees have been in bloom for 10 days. I am very well but am very home sick love and kisses to all I will write again before I leave </p>
