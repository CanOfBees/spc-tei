There was one thing we forgot to add, that is, whatever change you can get <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">recade, have a provision</unclear> inserted that it shall not be obligatory upon the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">company</unclear> until accepted by vote of the stockholders. Otherwise it might have been often as a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">precedent for recort eciu our cuduuuts</unclear> We are all anxiety about the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Neiwafer Reid = </unclear> road bill.
