        <p>Head-Quarters 6th East Tennessee Infantry.</p>
        <p>Near Knoxville, February 13 1864.</p>
        <p>Dr. Father,</p>
        <p>It has been many a day since I have heard directly from you and nearly as long since I wrote to you - You see by my heading that Regt Hd-Qrs are near here - We are on the Armstrong Ferry road just four miles from town and at the place of old man <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Ault -</unclear> there our Regt is in Winter Quarters and comfortably fixed - We have been there since about the 25 <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Ult</unclear> when we ceased our Retreat from Buffalo Creek in Grainger County - We were at Buffalo nearly a month - While there I saw several men who had been</p>

        <p>and some who still are friends of yours - Robert Loyd, J.T. West Thomas West and a good many others - Loyd and J.T. West are Rebs. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">ThS</unclear> West is a Union man - We marched to Flat Creek Bridge from Buffalo and remained near til all our trains and baggage etc were sent to Knoxville and then followed it - At <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Hannileal Sovis</unclear> we joined the main Army in its retrograde movement. We camped one night and next morning took up the line of march in column of Brigade's for K. tho 9 A. C. bringing up the rear until we marched the pike about 3 1/2 miles from town - Here the 9 A. c. unmasked the 23rd and it took position for battle but the enemy refused to give it - The only</p>

        <p>fighting after we cme to bay consisted in the skirmishes of our Brigade driving back the pursing cavalry about two miles - This was affected without any loss to us and very little if any to the enemy - The whole loss in the retreat after our Army crossed Holston was, I learn, one <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Lieut</unclear> and one private killed and perhaps half a dozen wounded <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Linor</unclear> that evening we have not been disturbed although Col. Cross had a captain and two men captured while on picket - and our Regt. has lost about ten men on different scouts.</p>
        <p>I think the boys have been much more quiet and obedient than the Authorities expected them to be - yet a few Rebs here have</p>

        <p><unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">filled</unclear> their nights - Sam Duncan of this country has been killed by a party unknown - Dick Pryor has been whipped - Jim Porter of the 14 District of Knox has been whipped. These are I think only instances I know of in which revenge has been taken personally for personal wrongs 0 Genl. Spears is now undergoing trial by Court Martial - Charges are using disloyal language - appropriating public property to private purpose and conduct prejudicial to Good order and Military discipline - The Charges were preferred at Dept Hd Qrs and are signed by Maj. Anderson and Aido to Genl. Foster I am only concerned in the matters as a witness - Of course you know my desire but I have taken no steps to bring on a trial - I think the charges will be substantiated - If they</p>

        <p>should not be the feeling of the Genl. sums to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">told</unclear> to make it anything but pleasant for all who are witnesses - He attempts to saddle it on each one and of course makes a mistake. I know how the whole originated and every opinion he has advanced as yet is incorrect - I shall <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">lit</unclear> it alone only as far as I am compelled to come into it as a witness - I am staying while a witness with mother as she is alone - I recieved for you, from Gov. Mayo, Twenty Dollars as rent for the Shephard house for one month a few days since and turned over the money to mother as your banker - I also rented the house to J. C.</p>

        <p>Lemones at $16.00 per month - I did this all the fence is gone and all the stables are torn down - He offered to give $250.00 per year if I would let him put a good fence about the lot and pay cost for the fence - I told him that at present I had no assurance that a fence could be kept there but should I find later that it could I might accept his proposition - Who he is I know not - He has been in the Reb. Army but has taken Abe's oath - I do not think he used to live here - He works for his <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">housing</unclear> I see and I know he has paid me one months rent in advance and proposes to pay in advance monthly - Have I acted rightly - Somet step must be taken to obtain compensation for the injury to our property and</p>

        <p>you know that as it must be done in your name, you are required to be present - I should not like to do it in my own name and on my own responsibility as you might not like my valuations</p>
        <p>But all can be arranged when you come - If you wish any think done please let me know and if it is in my power to do it I will do so -</p>
        <p>We are all well - Please write soon - What does the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">"Union"</unclear> mean? All send love - It is very late and I will defer until another time all further nonsense</p>
        <p>Yours affecly</p>
