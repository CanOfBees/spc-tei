And I further agree to woork up the cherry plank which said Burford bought of Mr Moses Lawson and if I should sell any of the furniture to take the note or notes payable to said Burford: It is however understood and agreed that on any paying to said Burford about ninety dollars that then said Burford is to relinquish to said Ramsey that above property. I also agree to sell to said Burford my Saddle, Bridle, and martingill for the above purpose also: and it is further understood and agreed that said Burford may take possesion of any part or the whole of said property at any time and dispose of the same as he may think best to secure said debt.</p>
