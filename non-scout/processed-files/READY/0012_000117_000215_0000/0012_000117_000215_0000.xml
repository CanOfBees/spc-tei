        <p>Dear Sir,</p>
        <p>We received this morning yours of 30th also referring to the shipments of 5 hhds tobacco and stating that you inclosed a bill of lading for it.  The bill of lading was not in the letter.  But we had received Thursday before by the steamer SS Harvard.  5 hh tobacco for your account on Steamer Senator.  We have today had it inspected and find it to be sold.  Some of it rather badly finished.  It shall receive due attention and when sold you shall hear from us.  The market is much more active this week than it has been for several months.</p>
        <p>Inclosed is an invoice of one sack Havanna Coffee ordered by you and shipped by the Steamer SS Harvard one month of Dixons Creek consigned to you with privilege of us helping &amp; storing if necessary at Nashville at your expense.  It will no doubt go straight on if the loads are running above Nashville at all.  We could not get a bill of lading through merchant ship privileges.</p>
        <p>The amount of invoice we place to your debit say $16.86 deferring to annexed card.  We are</p>
        <p>Very respectfully</p>
        <p>Your servants</p>
        <p>Perkins, Campbell</p>
