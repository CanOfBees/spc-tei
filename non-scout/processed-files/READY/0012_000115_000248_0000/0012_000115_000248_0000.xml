Flethers Rect. for Said Draft was forwarded with a duplicate of the written abstract to the Secretary of war, under date of 30th June 1814 it is not therefore possible for me to forward the duplicate as I did not take duplicates for the Draft, nor do I conceive it necessary that any thing But the abstract for which the Bill was drawn should be had to entitle me to the credit, but should it be required I can obtain his affidavit (if living and to be found) that he gave me a Rect for Sd. draft and that it was in payment for issues made as for abstract herewith. </p>

It is presomed that those Vauchers are Sufficient to entitle me to the Just credits</p>
