        <p>To the Honerable the General assembly of the State of Tennessee now in Session</p>
        <p>We whose names are here unto Subscribed represent to your Honerable body that we are informed, that Col. William <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Usney,</unclear> Pepe Lincoln and Anthony <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Dibrell,</unclear> have applied to the present General assembly for a charter to open a turnpike road from Sparta to Liberty and having further understood, that Said application does not meet the views of many inteligent and respectable citizens, who are interested in said road and that the same is <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">deamed</unclear> objectionable; and having also understood, that these objections have been clearly pointed out to said Lincoln, <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Usney and Dibrell,</unclear> and that they have concluded not to prep the application non before the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Legislature</unclear>
            </p>
        <p>We therefore, on behalf of the said <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Usney</unclear> and Lincoln, petion your Honerable body to grant them a charter to open a road leaving the present road at a point known by the name of the Knotty Oake, about three miles from Allens ferry and on the side <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">neset</unclear> to Sparta - to crop the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">cany</unclear> fork at Lockhurts, ann intersect the present road at Some convenient point on the South west line of the River - this would embrace a distance of about twelve miles</p>

        <p>posibly a little  more and possibly a little less and would pass over a country <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">susceptible</unclear> of higher improvement and would <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">admil of</unclear> a better road then the present <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">roul</unclear> it would also shorten the distance verry considerably from Sparta to Liberty, something like from two to three miles, the sid <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Usney</unclear> and Lincoln are willing to make a good road and to open it in such manner as shall be required by the Legislature. They are also willing and intend (if the Legislature will give them a charter)  to provide a safe substantial ferry boat to be used as such when eer it may be necessary - and charge no more for passing through there gate and also for corssing in the their ferry boat - than is now paid for ferrage at Allen ferry or in other <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">words</unclear> that the expences of travling the new road and passing through the gate and crossing the ferry, both shall not exceede, but shall be precisely equal to the sum now paid at Allen ferry, we ask this charter because we believe that the proposed change would be one of public utility, we also believe that the terms of the charter would be faithfully and honestly complied with by said <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Usney</unclear> and Lincoln</p>
