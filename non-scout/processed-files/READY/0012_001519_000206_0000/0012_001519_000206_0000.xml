        <p>Washington, Dec. 29 / 62</p>
        <p>My dear Washburn,</p>
        <p>I hope you were not much disappointed about going to Westboro' - It would have been a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">very &amp; hoch</unclear> visit, anyhow, &amp; since you have consecrated yourself to your country, it may be better for you to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">seek</unclear> your satifaction &amp; comfort in her service. I saved you Com. Blake's reason for declining to let you go - But for this order from the Sec'y of the Navy, I am certain he would have gratified you.</p>
        <p>I thank you, heartily, for your explanation respecting demerits I do not see, how you could</p>
        <pb n="2" facs="0012_001519_000206_0002.jpg" xml:id="d4e56"/>
        <p>avoid getting some marks, under the circumstances you describe but get as few as possible, &amp; disappoint those who would like to have you get a large number - I am delighted that you have taken so high rank, &amp; I expect to be proud to visit our Midshipman whenever I go there.</p>
        <p>Your father has talked with Mr. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Train</unclear> about getting John a place, &amp; he says he will try - I will write to John &amp; tell him about it. We have heard nothing more from your brother - Rosecrans is still at Nashville - We heard by way of John Brownslow, that James Cowan, Charles &amp; Frank McClung, <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Jo.</unclear> McDannell &amp; <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Trace Barry</unclear> have been forced into the Southern Army.</p>
        <p>Ann Mary sends love &amp; says she had a heap of Christmas Gifts. Father, too, sends love - We are going to Baltimore to pass the night - May God be with you, darling - </p>
        <p>Your Mother - </p>
