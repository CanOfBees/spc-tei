        <p>March 13th 1863</p>
        <p>Dear Brother,</p>
        <p>I received from you one day last week a letter containing your carte de visite and it is I think a very good likeness of my sailor boy - </p>
        <p>How much I do wish I was with you I can not now be satisfied in the Army. Still if I can not get to the Naval School I would like to go into the Regular Army, one of the two professions of arms must be mine - I have not heard from father or mother for some time. I suppose that Congress has adjourned and that father is on his way here and where our mother now is I cam at a loss to know.</p>
        <p>Duty is now all the go - I am on duty as "Officer in Charge" of pickets at least once a week and sometimes twice - Then we have little trips to make every now and then - Work sometimes on the fortifications and sometimes in unloading trains of provisions and ammunition - Yesterday I had from our Regt. 130 men on picket The Col. with 225 was gone to Versailles</p>
        <pb n="3" facs="0012_001519_000207_0003.jpg" xml:id="d4e64"/>
        <p>to guard a supply train and one Capt. and twenty five men were at the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">R.N.</unclear> depot unloading supply trains. And there were only 430 men reported for duty in the Regt. So you see it was nearly all at work.</p>
        <p>I was at Nashville one day last week. I there saw Lt. Col. Jas. P. Brownlow - He was well. He says their Regt. has duty to do also - Jim took Pryor Harris of Knoxville prisoner with his own hand - and got from him a horse worth 500 dollars - </p>
        <p>I met one of my Westboro schoolmates here - It was Geo. Stone sone of Jonas - He is a member of the 19th Illinois Infy - </p>
        <p>Parson Brownlow was here a few days ago He talks of starting his paper in Nashville I hope he will for then our Tenn Regts. will get their full share of praise.</p>
        <p>The First and Second E Tenn. Infy. have left us and gone back to Ky. I wish we could follow them - Because I believe  that that is the nearest route home and because as we know every path in those mountains we can do a great amount of damage to our enemies while here we work all the time and accomplish very little - Genl. Rosecrans says our Regt. is the best disciplined in his Army</p>
        <pb n="4" facs="0012_001519_000207_0004.jpg" xml:id="d4e79"/>
        <p>and that from him and of so many Regiments amounts to a great deal. Our folks got badly picked up at or near Spring Hill last week - Almost the whole of four Regts. of Infantry were taken. 1300 certainly were taken - One of the Regts. was with us all last summer and on our retreat from the Gap - The 33rd Indiana - It lost 445 men killed wounded &amp; prisoners - Every little while however we take a batch of Butternuts and send them one North. I think a forward move is intended soon as the signs are right. When we do start rebs. cannot stop us easily and unless their force is much larger than I think it is not at all.</p>
        <p>Well I have no news of importance to give you please write at once to me - With much love I close - </p>
        <p>Your afftc Brother</p>
        <p>Edward Maynard</p>
        <p>Lieut. Col. 6th E. T. Vols - </p>
