        <p>Washington Dec. 25th 1830</p>
        <p>Dear Sir,</p>
        <p>I Have received your letter of the 6th inst. enclosing of five dollars for the U.S. Telegraph from the 19th of Jany 1831 to the 19 th of Jany 1832. The recpt I herewith send you.</p>
        <p>I shall be sorry if Col. Turner should approve you for the senate and you seem to think he will, but do not think if he<unclear reason="illegible" resp="SLJ">[hole in paper]</unclear> it ought to alter your declarement <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SLJ">[hole in paper]</unclear> relation to Halls election, for I do not <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SLJ">[hole in paper]</unclear> it important that you should be silent as Turner, as well as yourself is in favor of Halls election. Imust <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SLJ">[hole in paper]</unclear> astove &amp; hes to learn that Hmton is agoing to run well in your County, and must</p>

        <p>believe that before the election the people will so well understand his true character taht they will not support him. See Hall and tell him that much depends upon his beeting Burton, that he can and will do it, if he will take the necessary pains. He has claims upon the people and he must not be afraid of being charged with egotism, if modesty reminds them of it. I have ascertained that the scroundrel Burton has been misiformity <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SLJ">[hole in paper]</unclear> dificulty between him and myself. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SLJ">[hole in paper]</unclear> to Genl Hall to press forward and shall give him a wing at the end of the present session. I have it in my power to prove by Gnl Donelson that <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SLJ">[hole in paper]</unclear> the same <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SLJ">[hole in paper]</unclear> to him, and which he denies when I stated it at Gallatin and for which</p>

        <p>I felt myself Justifiable in flagging him (Confidentially) I shall address a Circular to my cashments at the close of the present session and will be able to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SLJ">[hole in paper]</unclear> upon Burton his true character.</p>
        <p>Go and see Hall and tell him to counteract Burtons attempts to induce the people to believe he is an honest man and politician.</p>
        <p>Your friend</p>
