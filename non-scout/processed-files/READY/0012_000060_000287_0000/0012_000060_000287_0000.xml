        <p>Friday Night</p>
        <p>My Dear Wife</p>
        <p>The last intelligence you had from me I believe was from Charleston.  I left that place Wednesday 4 O'clock - had rather a boisterous voyage &amp; an uncommon number of passengers - nearly all of whom were sick - some of them very sick.  I slept none - had no berth - &amp; if there had been a spare one it was too hot &amp; sultry to live below deck  From C. to Wilmington by a steamer &amp; from the latter to the Potomac by R.R. is certainly the hottest &amp; most fatiguing travelling I ever did in all my life.  I have slept none now for two nights I feel weary &amp; disposed to sleep &amp; the moment this letter is finished &amp; sent down to the Bar I will be in bed.  I got here about 4 O'clock covered with dust smoke cinders but soon refitted &amp; called out to see some of our M.C's from Tennessee so as to be prepared for presenting Croziers business before the P.O. Department to morrow.  I could find none of them but Ewing from Nashville who treated me politely.  Genl. Houston was here ten minutes ago &amp; has just left.  He wished to serve me any way he could.  All the haste of the Board at Athens is just as I told them it would be for nothing.  That is my present impression.  I do not believe a bond can be sold at par &amp; of course no iron can be bought.  Keep this to yourself I have one resource left if others fail.  Judge Keyes was afraid of encountering the U.S. Marshall here or the Cholera - perhaps both &amp; went straight through to New-York where he will find more of it than here.  I dont think it is bad any where here north.  Never indulge uneasiness about my taking it.  I can be more careful hereafter than heretofore.  I have slept too little &amp; eaten too hurriedly.  I will take it more leisurely hereafter.  Monday I go on to New-York &amp; will write you or Crozier again.  Love to all of  you &amp; God's blessings attend you prays your af.</p>
