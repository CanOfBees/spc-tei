        <p>Monday May 23rd 1836</p>
        <p>Dear Sir,</p>
        <p>This will be handed you by my old friend and acquaintance Edmond Jennings who was a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LLW">soldier</unclear> of the Revolutionary War of the late war, and who was the first to enroll his name as a volunteer for the Southern frontier of the United States agreeable to your Proclamation of the 28th last, and assembled with the rest of us at this place on this morning to take up the line of march for Memphis by way of Nashville and but for your order on the 13th <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LLW">Just was it</unclear> who <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LLW">up the</unclear> volunteers with a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LLW">general</unclear> number would have left this morning Mr Jennings the soldier of the two wars is entitled to, and I have no doubt will receive the thanks of your Excellancy for his patriotism and zeal in behalf of his country, and although old and infirm, his zeal and patriotism cannot fail to have a powerful effect in favour of the cause with the younger portion of our fellow citizens of the state.</p>
        <p>Permit me to say in addition, that I hope the old Patriot will receive from you and the citizens of Nashville some publick manisfestation of approbation &amp; respect</p>
