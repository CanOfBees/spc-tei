        <p>Washington 11 June 1813</p>
        <p>Dear Sir</p>
        <p>When I wrote you the other day, respecting the action between The Frigates Chesapeake and Shannon, I did, from the news thus circulating fully believe
				  that our Vessel had proved Victorious _ It seems to be generally believed, and I fear with too much certainty that the Chesapeake has been taken _ It
				  appears that in the commencement of the action the British ship was very much injured in a very short time, having several masts shot away, which
				  inclined the Chesapeake to bear down in order to board, and just in the act of so doing so, there was a large Quantity of combustible matter thrown on
				  board from the English Ship, seting great part of our vessel in a compleat flame, which is thought to be the cause of her immediate striking __ It is said, 
				  and generally believed, that there was some infernal machine thrown, of an entire distructive nature, but what the damage have been, we are not yet 
				  informed__</p>
        <p>General Dearborne has taken Fort George, Queenstown, and Fort Erie, with little loss, and was in pursuit of the enemy who were endeavouring to make
			           their retreat down to</p>
        <pb n="3" facs="0012_000543_000215_0003.jpg" xml:id="d4e61"/>
        <p>to the lower Canaday __ Our fleet on The lakes under Commodore Channecy, appear to be Overruning The British in every opportunity they have when
				  coming into contact with the enemy _ I believe the British only posess one Garrison in U. Canady, (Malden) and it is very probable, that The American Flag
				  is now flying at that place. __ We are progressing very slowly ___ </p>
        <p>Remember me affectionately to our friends__ I am entirely sick at being so long from home, and believe if I was <unclear reason="illegible" resp="PW">onr</unclear> 
				  more there, I should never return __ I had like to have forgot to mention, that Cozen Alex Sevier have had a duel with one of your Captains _ A, received
				  a shot through his arm, his adversary one in the breast, but thought not to be mortal __</p>
        <p>Your affectionate Friend</p>
        <p>John Sevier</p>
        <p>Col. Sevier</p>
