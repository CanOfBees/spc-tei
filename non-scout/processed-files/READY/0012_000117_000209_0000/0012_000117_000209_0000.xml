        <p>Dear Sir,</p>
        <p>We received  yesterday yours of 17th sent from Nashville accompanied by one from W.G. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="PW">Shepard</unclear>Co. Covering this check on Canal Bank for $1500.00 Fifteen hundred Dollars for your credit as shown in the enclosed statement of your account Current which we send at your request.</p>
        <p>It is made up with interest to 16th November 1853 exhibiting a balance due you as that date of $6,836.60 (Six thousand eight hundred thirty six  60/100 Dollars, which, with accruing interest after that time) is subject  to your drafts at one day after sight divided in sum to suit your convenience in  selling as in One. The prevalance of an epidemic at the time the $5,000. was sent &amp; for a month after prevented us from making an investment satisfactory to ourselves, but had your letter been a day or two later it would have been invested as we were yesterday called upon with  a note we had agreed to buy for you @ 8% some ten days ago for the even sum of 5000.00.</p>
        <p>We held on <unclear reason="illegible" resp="PW">ys ofc</unclear>the note of Littlejohn <unclear reason="illegible" resp="PW">M</unclear>due 19 June 1834  amounting with interest to that date $1512.00. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="PW">Cjm</unclear>Jenkins, Campbell&amp; Co.</p>
