        <p>Knoxville October 26th 1795</p>
        <p>Sir</p>
        <p>The time you propose for sending the Powder Lead &amp; other Articles for The Indians is as Soon as I could expect. I did not recollect the order to you as to the mode of authenticating deliveries to Indians. My only object in mentioning Col. McKee as the person in whose presence Such deliveries Should be made was because I knew he would be at the Spot where the delivery was ordered to be made. It was not an Inclination to infringe on the duties of your office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dinsmoor will I presume wait until the deliveries are made &amp; to Indians I Should Suppose Agents would be the best evidences of the Delivery. I have considered that the Contracts made with Barclay McGee for Supplies at the Conference would extend to the time the Creeks will leave Tellico Block House &amp; at present I foresee no necessity for Agent at that Place after that time but Should I find one Necessary I will give you notice.</p>
        <p>I am  Your obedient Servant</p>
        <p>WmBlount</p>
        <p>Col. David Henley</p>
        <p>Agt. for the Department of War.</p>
