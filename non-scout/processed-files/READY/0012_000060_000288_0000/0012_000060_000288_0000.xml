        <p>Washington July 27. 1850.</p>
        <p>Dear Crozier</p>
        <p>Since I wrote you at Dalton my
					movements have been so telegraphic that I have not often had a minute of leisure
					to devote to any thing but eating a hurried dinner or other meal along the road.
					Think of the speed - you eat breakfast at Chattanooga on the bank of the
					Tennessee river this morning to morrow morning you take breakfest at Aiken S.C.
					several miles east of the Savannah. At 2 O'clock of the same day you are in
					Charleston. Thus passing from the western base of the Apalachian chain to the
					coast of the Atlantic in about thirty two hours. I leave you to compute through
					these data the time which will be consumed in a trip from Knoxville to
					Charleston, when the R. Road shall be completed from Dalton to your city. The
					time is so short - the transportation so rapid - that when you pass over the
					route the first time you can scarcely realise where you are &amp; how you got
					there. I have passed over most of the route often but every time I am impressed
					more &amp; more with the grandeur &amp; magnificence of the public works of
					Georgia &amp; South Carolina - &amp; equally so with the inappreciable
					importance of an extension of these works to Tennessee. To say not one word
					about the results that must follow a commercial identity between the South
					Atlantic &amp; the West or the reciprocal social improvement that will accompany
					it I ask you to look for a moment only at its effects upon our own people &amp;
					our own interests. In my last if I recollect right I said or began to say
					something on the subject but the whistle of the locomotive admonished me that I
					could not then enlarge upon the idea &amp; it was therefore given to you
					incomplete. I say then here briefly that earlier in the growth of Tennessee no
					one of her citizens - especially no young man dared</p>
        <pb n="2" facs="0012_000060_000288_0002.jpg" xml:id="d4e52"/>
        <p>ever to feel that his life was purposeless or that it must remain necessarily
					uneventful. At that day every one hewed out his own fortune by his sword - his
					manly energies or his noble self reliance. In every department of life a field
					was opened up for the display of abilities - &amp; a theatre presented to the
					aspiring - the ambitious &amp; the energetic for the manifestation of those
					virtues &amp; excellencies that signalized so immently the lives of our older
					citizens. A wilderness was to be subdued - defences were to be erected &amp; the
					savage had to yield to civilized man. The foundations of government were to be
					laid - the structure of society to be formed - &amp; the <unclear reason="Illegible" resp="JH">beneficent</unclear> institutions of learning
					and religion were to be established. The Anglo-American &amp; especially the
					South Western pioneer was competent to the full discharge of all these lofty
					functions. To their adequacy for all these duties let the part of Tennessee be
					the evidence &amp; the proud memorial.</p>
        <p>But I beg to enquire, is the field
					any where unocupied? - is the theatre still open on which the younger men of the
					country may still be employed with credit to themselves &amp; usefulness to
					Tennessee? Or are all channels of enterprise &amp; distinction so filled up or
					obstructed as to drive much of the virtue, intelligence, capacity &amp; public
					spirit of our people into involuntary exile &amp; expatriation? You know I never
					despond - but the time has been when an unwelcome answer would have been given
					to these questions. Candor would not have allowed a different one. The insulated
					position of our country - the obstructions to its common with world - the value
					of our products entirely sunk in the exportation of them to a market - had
					paralized the energies &amp; weighs like a heavy incubus upon the vitals of our
					people. The heart of the farmer sunk at the</p>
