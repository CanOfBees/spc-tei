## SPC-TEI ##

This repository contains two groups of files - currently delivered, and undelivered.

### from-scout + from-scout-mods ###
These are the currently delivered TEI and their corresponding MODS records.

### non-scout + non-scout-mods ###
These are TEI transcriptions that, for any number of reasons, never made it online.

There are only corresponding TEI and MODS for the files under `non-scout/processed-files/READY`; the TEI under `non-scout/processed-files/{HOLD,problems}` has problems of one sort or another.
