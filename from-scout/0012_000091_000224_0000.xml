               <note type="abstract">17 July 1865 David L. Jones in Nashville, Tenn., to his wife Anna in Allegheny City, Pa. Takes a break from preparing for a general inspection of everything in his regiment, to write to his wife. Expresses his exasperation at the lack of dignity, discipline, and order represented mostly by those in command, i.e., all night parties, public drunkenness, etc. Because of the very slow, but consistent, departure of paid-off soldiers, rampant sickness, and poor planning, there are not enough men to share duty shifts. Another regiment has arrived to help out where most needed. Much of their repetitious conversation is a result of their letters crisscrossing in the mail.</note>
