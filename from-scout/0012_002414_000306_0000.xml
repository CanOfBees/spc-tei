            <p>Chas. Pettit Esqr.</p>
            <p>Dear Sir</p>
            <p>I wrote you on the 31st <unclear reason="illegible" resp="pw">Ulto.</unclear>to which beg leave to refer, &amp;the present Serves
				       chiefly to enclose you a translated Copy of the Protest made by Captn. John Murphy of Schr. Betsy at Point Peter Guadaloupe on this
				       5th March 1794 relative to the forcible Seizure of his Cargo by the Municipality of that place for use of the french Government, also a
				       Second Protest made by Captn. Murphy &amp;two of his Crew after their return to this Country, dated Baltimore 30th May 1794,
				       wherein the Circumstances of the Case are fully explained, a claim was immediately made to the french Government vi France for
				       payment of the outward Cargo taken at Guadaloupe, which was placed under the management of Mr. Skipweth, but could not be
				       admitted under the Loisiana Treaty, nor could any payment or Satisfaction whatever be obtained for the same notwithstanding every
				       exertion being made for that purpose, on examining the Contents of those protests your long experiance will suggest the proper mode
				       of Settling the Loss on Cargo, &amp;if it should Correspond with my ideas it will afford me much pleasure to write you on the ground
				       of Settling the Business without the interference of Arbitrators in case you prefer this mode, otherwise I am ready &amp;perfectly
				       satisfied to have the whole Business submitted to Arbitration as already mentioned in my former letters</p>
            <p>I am very respectfully</p>
            <p>Dear Sir</p>
            <p>your Most Hble: Servt.</p>
