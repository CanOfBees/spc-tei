            <p>My Dear Sons Nashville, March 25th 1865</p>
            <p>James Andrew &amp; Thomas</p>
            <p>Saturday afternoon after dinner I sit me down to write a few lines to you in hope that they will find you well as they leave me thank the Lord We are too far from each other now to talk to each other But it is a great Blessing that we can make each acquainted with each other s feelings by writing when I was with you i use to tell you to stick to your books learn your lessons well try and get No 1 deportment I wanted you to practice writing you do not see the value of that yet it was for your own good that I told you these things you that that it was very hard in me to ask you do these things</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="0012_000091_000202_0002.jpg" xml:id="d3e168"/>
            <p>But if you was to come here for a while you would see the value of it There is a great many men in our Company that cant write they have to get others to write for them if they had done as their Parents wanted them to do it is likely that they could write for themselves And all of you yet will be a great ways from your Mother and Sick among strangers and nobody to give you as much as a drink of cold water then you will say i wish i could write to my mother It is little you think of that when your mother asks you to do some little turn for her it is a great trouble to do it Now I want you to be good boys do what your Mother wants you to do help her to take care of Sharon and the Babe dont take anything that dont belong to you Be kind to your play mates and they will be kind to you Be kind to your Brothers and Little Sister I love one of you Just as much as i do the other</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_000091_000202_0003.jpg" xml:id="d3e176"/>
            <p>Now James your Mother sent to me that she had a notion of sending you out to your Aunt Sarah I am satisfied so long as you behave youself <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW"> wherer </unclear> you dont do as they tell you they must send you home If i am spared I shall write your letters and put them in your Mother s Letter see that she can send them to you mind and write to your Mother do it so as to learn to write I want you to take your Testament with you and read as often as you can As i promised you when i left that I would, give you all a nice Present Now the Best Boy will get the best present Andy your Mother shall be the Judge as to which had been the best boy I guess will want a ginger horse for Sharon and Anna May Now I have nothing else to tell you at present try and live up to it as well as you can you can do great many things if you will only try to do it</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="0012_000091_000202_0004.jpg" xml:id="d3e187"/>
            <p>I want you to think on what i say I think often of you I should like to know whether you have the bower made yet and whether the grape vine is buded yet or not the Peach trees are in Bloom here it is right cold here get <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">yet tio </unclear> there was a heavy white frost here this Morning Now I must finish the letter for we have to clean ourselves and our guns ready for Dress Parade at 5 o clock this evening And Tomorrow if i live if i live and tomorrow night i expect to be on guard So i dont think as i shall have the chance of going to Church But i can think of you about the time that you will be starting for Sabbath school and tomorrow there will be two Paredes what i must attend if not on guard From your Father David</p>
