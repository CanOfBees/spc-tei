            <p>rather pleasant. She seems to be rather quick of speach a bit set in her ways
					quite proud of her ability, and autho-rative in her manner - a bit dictetorial
					and most old maidish in her smile. It drops some ime like Miss Finleys when it
					starts up you think of some one supremely happy where it ends you think of some
					one who has dropped a hot potato. But with it all I think she is capable and I
					anticipate no great toubles.</p>
            <p>Miss Nixon is a young girl full of enthusiasm and willingness I believe she will
					make a success. She is jolly and full of fun. I cannot understand how a human
					can be so homely She is skinny with red hair (bobbed) and prominent teeth. Each
					one stand-ing out by itself. But such is life.</p>
            <p>Miss Bridgeman is very attractive, but very unhappy I think. I do not like Miss
					Wrights attitude toward her nor yet Miss Nixons. She has visualized Alaska and
					has not found it to be the land of her dreams. I wish there were some hep for

            <p>thing. It is a great mistake to have three workers in a place. One is most always
					unhappy. There should be either two or four women.</p>
            <p>When I looked at my mail I found a letter from the Bishop which endorsed a letter
					in full which M<emph>r</emph> Drane had written. He limits my work to the
					Tanana Valley from Tanana to Tanana Crossing. At Dranes advice - I suppose, and
					his crafty working forced it. he did not permit me to make the Arch-deacons
					rounds. I am disgusted and sore over the whole situation. I am also very
					surprised that the Bp. would endorse such an insultin gletter to any man.</p>
            <p>M<emph>r</emph> Dranes letter was the most insulting letter I have ever
					received He gives no one I suppose any credit for intelegence. It was dictorial
					and authorative. Small in every deatail. I am sure he would or rather could
					never have told me the things he wrote in that letter. The days that no one</p>

            <p>He left his cabin which I had to come into a filthy mess. It looked as though he
					were coming back tomorrow but I should have been ashamed to enter it if I had

            <p>We simply have to do the best we can and let it go at that. I told Ketzler that
					simply became I married them did not permit them to live <del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">against</del> in the village. The
					Commissioner told him the same thing. I shall see to it that he does not live
					there at any time. It is both against the U.S. law of which men to live on an

            <p>It was sad to bury little Samuel today. I hate to see the younger generation go
					for they are the only hope of the existance of a native race. It hurts worse to
					see them marry white men for then the problem of half breed children comes. It
					is the saddest and most difficult of all. I hope the races never amalgimate and
					I do not think they will even in years to come.</p>
            <p>The trouble with is that she is Bonita is that she is a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Sheshitua</unclear> native and the native
					people never mix tribes. none of the boys in the village will marry girls from
					other villages She really did not want to marry Dick K. but her old mother made

            <p>Luke Jimmy is in the village as drunk as he was seven years ago. John Paul

            <p>A big mail came in today. A good letter from Rosa a good letter from <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Capers Satterlee</unclear> and others. I was

            <p>School house was full of people and Henry Thomas intreperted well. The offering

            <p>This afternoon I spent in prayer and this evenig Miss Nixon gave three very

            <p>Talked with her in her room in the Hosp. for 2 hours and 15 minutes until he
					arrived at 8:45.. When I saw her I was appalled and distressed at the agony and
					dispair her face showed. <del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">Her</del> It was
					drawn and her eyes were sunken with blue circles. There were no tears, but utter
					helplessness and depression.</p>
            <p>She told me of the experience down town and all that had passed between them.
					Since her engagement. She did not know what to do. I advised and urged that she
					not marry him. The only conclusion was that she would not marry him if he were
					drinking.</p>
            <p>There were two men with him when he came. After they entered the door he tried to
					introduce them to me but was so intoxicated he could neither remember nor speak
					thier names. nor could he remember my name and we had to introduce
					ourselves.</p>
            <p>I told him I wanted to speak to him privately so we came over to the cabin.</p>
            <p>First I approached him on the matter of the license being signed</p>

            <p>before the notary Republic with his signature attached. He then wantd to phone Mr
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Lecky</unclear> to gain his consent. I
					told him It has to be signed in his presence with his signature attached.</p>
            <p>By this time we had came in to the Cabin and I told him that I could not marry a
					man who was intoxicated. and asked him if he had been drinking He said he was
					drunk the other night. Then I asked him if he had any today. That made him sore.
					He began to tell how he expected to treat Miss B. after he married her and how
					white he had been etc. I asked him again if he had had any today and he said no.
					I said well you are drunk now.</p>
            <p>Then he flew off and said he was going to take her anyway and marry her down town
					He began to argue religion and The Church, Roman Caholicism etc and said some

					she would not marry him but here she failed again. And this failure will stick
					with her through life. She has not yet told him she would not marry him.</p>
            <p>Hr attitude towards me now is a most peculiar one. I think she blames me for not

            <p>The funny thing was that she and Miss Nixon came over and said &quot;it&apos;s

            <p>Knoxville. Hot with showers.</p>
            <p>This morning it was my privilege to assist D<emph>r</emph> Whitaker at St
					John&apos; Knox-ville in the celebration of the Holy Com-munion for the first
					time. I read the Epistle and administered the chalice. Rosa and Lena received.
						D<emph>r</emph> Whitaker preached a good sermon on Education.
					Encouraging the people not only to send their sons to college and emphesizing
					the importance a college education, but urging them to support the U.T. by
					sending their sons there. I felt the sting as I sat there and thought how old
					Sewanee was crying out for good men. In his an-nouncements he said he was going
					to a meet-ing of the Board of Trustees and would be away next Sunday. Someday my
					hearts desire will be granted and Sewanee will ride high. A visit to Mildreds
					found her suffering with rhumatism. We took Lena home and Mildred and Bob &amp;

            <p>It is a great satisfaction to see Roy and his two dear little girls growing up
					and doing so well. With his home paid for and his efforts. and success to live a
					godly christian life giving a tenth part of his earnings and Ruth devotion and
					her desire and success to serve and help him makes me very hapy. He has a nice
					garden and his bees are doing well. Nothing is as much of a satisfaction as to
					see some one with a hobby to interest them and with Roys earnestness and ability
					he will make a great success with his bees. Some day he will rise to the top of
					his profession, instead of head bookeeper I hope he will be a president of some
					bank. If deadly war and destruction comes agan Howard too will rise to the top
					of his propension and be a general instead of Lieut. Colonol I earnestly desire
					the prosperity and success of my family for I love them and <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">ambitious</unclear> for them. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">MiA</unclear> The Godly devotion and loving

            <p>Mamma and I have anticipated our trip to Sewanee all day and thought we would
					start off tomorrow but a telegram from M<emph>rs</emph> Preston started us
					off tonight instead. I knew my <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">gruk</unclear> had not <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">kirns</unclear> finished but did not expect M<emph>r</emph> Hasket Du
					Bose to flunk me in Hebrew. That Hebrew is horrible stuff when it comes to
					learning it. and unfortunately M<emph>r</emph> Du B. does not know how to
					teach it. It seems too bad that Sewanee has to suffer so much from its low
					stand-ard of proffesors. There are many things wrong with Sewanee many things of
					vital importance to be corrected, but in many ways it is the most wonder-ful
					place in the world. I love it and will always do what I can for it. There is
					much to be done. I am glad that Mamma can be there with me for a few days. She,
					I feel sure will enjoy it though the life there is very different from any she
					is use to. I am sorry the train is crowded and that she must be so uncomfortable
					and have to get up at 3:30 in the morning, but she is a good sport</p>

            <p>This is Miss Bridgeman&apos;s birth day so we came out in full dress. The first

            <p>One year ago today the Archdeacon was with us and the Alumni Corperate Communion

					did not arrive in time and now it will not be unveiled until Founders Day 10<emph>th</emph> October 1921. After a brief service on the chapel we
					marched in procession to the Sun Dial which was dedicated by Bp. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Ywery</unclear> and a talk by Miss Sarah
					Barnwell Elliotte told how Old <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Forensic</unclear> was built and what became of it. I thought how The A.
					would like to have heard her. We then marched in procession to the stone where

            <p>Knoxville.</p>
            <p>I am finding some time to reread the Archdeacons last book on Alaskan Missions-
					The History. It is fascinating and thought of those heroic pioneers fills me
					with anticipation and joy. I am glad that I have gotten as far along as I have
					even to serve in the &quot;Inferior&quot; office of Deacon. I thank God for His
					mercy and Blessing that He has been pleased to call me and has counted me worthy
					to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">servethin</unclear> I hope I shall move
					more worthy and capable as time goes on. I hope I shall better please Him with
					my life and work. I am glad to be counted one of the pioneers of That Great
					Alaskan work. A card from Bill Holden assures me that he is having a good time
					with Ben <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Studerant</unclear> on his boat
					try and camp <del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">on the</del> at McMinnville
					Tenn. Bill is a fine boy with character and manhood. God be with him and deliver
					him out of his distress. I hope he can visit me here at home and I hope that I
					shall always be able to keep in touch with him. A number of callers came in
					tonight Mildred, <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Inela</unclear>, and the
					Miller Family. I hope to see M<emph>r</emph> Clarke to-morrow. Gods
					Blessing upon my family.</p>

            <p>We were up at 4:30 to make ready to go down to Walters to spend a few days. The
					buss left the Service Garage at 6:30. The ride was most pleasant with Mamma.
					especially as far as Oliver Springs, for there we had to change to a smaller
					buss which was more tiresome It was pleasant though as Mamma seemed to enjoy it
					so. Walter met us and we drove over to the house which was clean and the
					children were so clean and happy. Lola said very sweetly &quot;Roses on my
					shoulders and slippers on my feet etc.&quot; It makes my heart sick to see them
					in such a terrible condition a helpless poverty. It is impossible too to keep
					keep the flys out of the old log cabin. May God be pleased to send them help
					from above. I wish I had money enough to buy it from them at a big price and use
					it later for a summer home for the family <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">wen</unclear> if I never get a chance to live on it myself.</p>
            <p>We sat up - Walter, Pearl and I - and talked on things religious and about
					Baptism and the church. I am very happy that they are soon to give themselves to
					Christ in the Sacrement of Holy Baptism.</p>

            <p>After a late <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">head</unclear> fast Walter and

					potatoes. This afternoon we drove over to Wartburg<del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">s</del> to meet Papa, but he could not come. I phoned him, am
					sorry he could not come up for the baptism. He would have joined the trip and
					the service. We were late getting home, but I went to bed early and had a good
					much needed rest. The farm is in good shape now, and looks mighty pretty. But
					Walter <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">must</unclear> get him and the
					place for bed rock in this palce is much too near the service. Fertalizer does
					little good. Should not be able to spend the rest of my life in Alaska as I hope

					Eula Amelia. My first baptisms since my ordination and it made me <emph>very</emph>
               <emph>very</emph> happy. I am sure now that their lives will be more happy
					and prosperous. There is a true change of heart and mind. They love God, trust
					Him and believe in Him. And were happy to confess Him before Christ before the
					large congregation gathered there. I fixed an altar with the small cross that
					Johnnie Fred made for me. and had a short service combining the two baptismal
					services for <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Iuponts</unclear> and thou
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">grives</unclear> years and Evening

					continually and know God will make them humble and pure in heart and prosper

					Creek bottom and fertile. It makes me long the more for a creek or river bottom
					farm for Walter. He is in some distress and dire need. Uncle Ed. is rich and
					prosperous but in a way does not at all appreciate what it means. We left there
					at 12:00 M. on the Buss and suffered the long and tiresome journey reaching
					Knoxville at 4:30. for $1.85. M<emph>r</emph> A M Fitts at Petros asked me
					to send him a peace of a power which it was my pleasure to do. My mail brought

					need the material assistance, and too, I feel that it is their part to help me
					going out from their parish. It is not that I want them to help me financially
					but I think they should show a personal interest in any one who is going out to
					the mission field to represent them. D<emph>r</emph> W. expressed without
					doubt his feeling to ward Alaska and the the work of the Church there. He holds
					some real grievances which it is natural enough for him to hold. From what he
					said he thinks, undoubtly that the Board of Missions is dishonest in its methods
					and dealings with Alaska and so do I. I think they <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">mirs</unclear> up resent the field and I do not see what be-comes

            <p>These days so filled with interest and pleasure will never be forgotten. Howard
					and Margaret have a lovely house and with &quot;Peggy&quot; they are most happy
					in it. It is a six room <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">bungats</unclear>
					with hard wood floors and very attractive finishings as well as very handsome
					furnishings. Every thing in it is in good taste and it is not overly furnished.
					The entire house is characteristic of sweet and beautiful natures of Margaret
					and Peggy and Howard. It has been a real pleasure to be here. &quot;Peggy&quot;
					and I went down to the zoo. this morning and enjoyed seeing the various animals.
					When one of the otters began to chase a squrrell that accidentally got into the
					cage it caused great delight to the by standing children <del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">among</del> of whom I was one. This evening
					I spent one of the most delightful dinner hours I have ever spent. Father W. L.
					Devries 3515 Woodley Road with his many stories full of fun and good humor
					cultural and educational Ript us full of laughter. Noble Powell, and <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Tilinane</unclear> sharp were there and

            <p>Howards.</p>
            <p>This has been a full and interesting day. I went up with Howard this morning and
					climbed up the Wash. Monument. It stands 500 feet high and from the top is a
					most super view of the whole city. The elevator was not runing so I had the
					pleasure of climbing the stairs and seeing all the memorials of the state to
					Washington. That quotation from Lincoln &quot;The Union must be Preserved&quot;
					on the Tennessee Memorial gripped me. I am afraid I am not a reconstruction
					southerner. The <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">mislann</unclear> was
					wonderfully interesting and fascinating. The <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">berst of orgytion</unclear> kings and the Alaska display and most
					of all the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Asties</unclear> Indian display
					interested me. Then was the cylindrical stone of its <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">mon</unclear> and the Calendar Stone. And then was the temples and
					all those things of intense interest. The painting of Denali with the incorrect
					data <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">writh</unclear> under annoyed me. It
					is not a very perfect painting either. The Mountain is more <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">se-cuding</unclear> and bold then the painting
					represents it. The foregrounds is more beautiful and <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Ithig</unclear> is sharper in nature than in the painting. I am
					familiar with the the particular view pntd and I am not very pleased with it.
					The afternoon was spent at home working about the home and garden. We washed
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">daddy in &apos;Deyjors&apos;
						doge</unclear> a beautiful Scotch collie. Margaret is quite ill and I am
					sorry.</p>

            <p>This morning I stayed at home to pack my <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">grip</unclear> and suitcase. Margaret was feeling better and got up late to
					say good bye. Packing is such a horrible job and I hate it especially that each
					time it reminds me that I am saying good bye to some I shall not see again.
					Margaret is to undergo a serious operation about the 1<emph>st</emph> of
					August in all probability. I feel assured she will come out o.k. That was the
					last touch of real home for three years. &quot;Peggy&quot; is certainly a
					brilliant little girl so sweet and so entertaining. On the way over I read parts
					of the back of the books on government records M<emph>r</emph> Brooks gave
					me. I came from Broad St Station straight out here to &quot;Midhope&quot; and
					found the Misses Booth <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">oe</unclear>
					charming and wonderful as ever and they seemed almost as glad to see me as I to
					see them. I am thankful to God that He has restored to me their friendship the
					only one of the old set of a few years ago that I prayed so earnestly for. They
					are friends worth having. So thoughtful and so kind. They had a Miss McKullie
					here for diner who afterwards took us but to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">ped</unclear> St David&apos;s church about which Longfellow wrote
					that beautiful poem when we returned we read the poem. I must con-fess that all

            <p>It does hardly seem possible that I am this far on my way to my destination which
					yet lies many thousands of miles off. Surely I shall recall this happy evenig
					with much pleasure when I get into my Small log cabin surrounded by Indians. I
					like hotels for I feel so free in them. I did not find cousin Alices&apos;
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">mama</unclear> on the register, but
					doubtless she is here. I came in from the Booths this morning early and went up
					to the Deaconess school to see Deaconess <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Carter</unclear>. She was on her vacation. I found most of the store in
						Phil<emph>a</emph> closed and amng them Thornton and Voigt the
					Tailors. I had hoped they could measure me up for a suit. The rest of the mornig
					and part of the evenig was happily spent with Bertha and the Rongs. Bertha looks
					well and I love her better than any one outside the family, but I am afraid I
					can never marry her. I know I cannot for she is many years too old for me and
					she is ill in a way that it would not do to marry her. She could never bear me
					children for her condition would never permit. Dorothy Roney is a most <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Livert</unclear> and attractive girl and I had
					a most delightful talk with her advising her about her college work as well as
					her religious life. She goes to Maryville <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Temn</unclear> this fall and entering into the social life there she will

            <p>Getting in so late last night with such a confusion of times I was unable to
					arise early enough this morning for Early service. Later, however, I met Cousin
					Alice and we went to the Grand Central for breakfast. We took all our meals over
					there today. The service at 11:00 oclock at St Mary&apos;s the Virgin was very
					beautiful and impressive. I enjoyed it and heard a splendid sermon on the injust
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">student</unclear>. Emphesizing the
					&quot;wisdom of the world&quot; is concentrating on one thing yet not leaving
					out the necessity of the spiritual and on relation with God but using the
					&quot;wisdom&quot; for Gods purpose. Though the afternoon we rested and after
					dinner went down to Calvery for evenig prayer. The sermon poorly constructed and
					delivered was just St James as tomorrow is St James&apos; day. I have tried to
					reach M<emph>r</emph> Betticher but have been unable to. It seems good to
					be in NY. Again. I love the big city. When I am off there in the far North land
					I shall miss it dreadfully. I am eager to know what the future near and a little
					further off has in store. God grant that I shall be able to do His Holy will in
					all things. I anticipate much Walter and his family is much on my heart and

					strap and a splendid portfolio with four compartments strap all around and were
					stitched. Perhaps not quite as well made though an English goods. M<emph>r</emph> Horton came to the Hotel Fry to see us off. There was a most
					pleasant hour spent at Victoria. We took a rubber neck car and drove over the
					city on the left hand side of the street. Vict. is just a spot of England

            <p>This morning we rose to find the stern of the boat switched around some twenty

					of the Dear Archdeacon. How terrible the loss. &apos;Old &apos;Hap&quot; did not
					seem happy any more. He told me of Dranes visit and his critical attitude here
					and of his dislike for him. Also of his urging the Bp. to make me Archdeacon as
					the Archdeacon desired it. The Bp. promised that he would make Dranes appt.
					Temporary we talked much of old friends at Sewanee and then he took me to the
					Arch. room. There were his books and all How I wish the Archdeacon was here, but
					his Spirit is here. He lives still. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">JB.</unclear> gave me some books and the Individual communion service the

            <p>This morning I had the pleasure of reading some of the Archdeacon&apos;s Diaries.
					They are filled with Interest and beautifully written. At eleven the Bishops
					rather insulting wire came.</p>
            <p>&quot;You have my instructions go to Nenana&quot;</p>
            <p>I do not understand the Bp&apos;s attitude toward me. I do not understand why he
					has given me no welcome, why he did not wait for me at Nenana. Why he with holds
					me from being ordained when he is so in need of clergy I should think he would
					be a bit more accomodating to his own clergy. This afternoon I went out to the
					Dear Archdeacons grave and felt his death and the loss of his championship
					for the work of Alaska as I have never felt it before. I realize that I have
					lost a dear friend and companion, and I deeply grieve his loss. To-day it seemed
					like a real loss. Surely his prayers in paradise are for me still.</p>
            <p>M<emph>rs</emph> Burke has been very kind and con-siderate. Somehow I dread
					to go to Nenana with Miss Wright and all the misery that awaits me with no
					welcome, but why, I need not God is with me. Barheit is certainly a pleasant
					fellow I enjoy being with him. I wired D<emph>r</emph>

            <p>Another gray day, but I have always been fond of rain so do not mind the
					anti-cipation of it. The Alaska is due to arrive at Dawson to-night and will
					probably return Sunday - I have packed a bit and am nearly ready to go. I wish I
					were going to stay. I had a most pleasant dinner at the Hosp. tonight the nurses
					there are lovely. This after-noon I wrote several letters and sent a money order

					Allakaket if I make the Archdeacon&apos;s trip this winter. In all probability
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Deane</unclear> has so arranged it
					that I shall not be able to. He is a jealous office seeking man from what I know
					of him. I dread to see him take the Dear Archdeacon&apos;s place.</p>
            <p>I have worked a good deal on my sermon which I shall probably not have to preach.
					I wish I were a good preacher. I wish I had a good grounding. I wish I cared to

					be with me. I am thinking much of home these days.</p>

					keenly. I did not realize it. This is the only day I have felt settled enough to
					do anything. I hope I shall be able to do my work so that it will be pleasing to
					God when I get to Nenana.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow we hope to build the coping and posts around the Dear archdeacon&apos;s

            <p>With no one to meet me save a drayman I walked up through the village desolate

					I have heard but one voice to welcome me and have one native to remember me I

            </p>
            <p>This has been a gloomy day in many ways. My first impress-ion of Nenana is that
					it is grown up in <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">werds</unclear> in every
					way. Intellec-tualy, morally, and spirtually. I have been looking around the
					place a bit to try to find happy <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">munoies</unclear>.</p>
            <p>Part of the day I worked in the cabin cleaning it up and I walked down town to
					get some shades for my windows. They were $10<emph>00</emph> at Louis
					Andersons. It was nice to see M<emph>r</emph> Anderson again.</p>
            <p>The children seem to have a much happier spirit than they had before when I was
					here. Miss Wright is <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">fine</unclear> with
					children but not so with other workers. She is another one of those individual
					workers though someone may be able to follow her alright</p>
            <p>I find the beautiful altar Johnnie made standing in the schoolroom. Miss W. tells
					me that Drane is going to have a call to his Fathers Parish.</p>

            <p>Nenana.</p>
            <p>I wrote a letter to Mamma and the family today. This afternoon I went down to
					mail it and called on Mr &amp; M<emph>rs</emph> Phillips and Mr Martin
					from Tanana Crossing. He is going to cut my wood for me for the winter.</p>
            <p>Some time I have spent in pre-paring my sermon. I have not studied or written
					very much of it. a letter was here from Dr. Whtaker <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">wit</unclear> the original cheque for $150. and per-mission to use
					the $50 for equipment given me at my ordination.</p>
            <p>In my letter home I sent a M.O. for $50<emph>00</emph> 25 to Mamma and 25
					to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Walt.</unclear> I also told mother I
					would have $300<emph>00</emph> sent her from my salary. $5<emph>00</emph> per month for Rosa and $5<emph>00</emph> per month for Papa
					the rest for herself.</p>
            <p>Upon my arrival I found all the books sent from Miss Thomas C.P.C. and two green
					stoles one <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Madara</unclear> and one from

            <p>Nenana. Sometimes cloudy sometimes sunshine.</p>
            <p>I sent a telegram to the Bankers today &quot;Travels limited to Tanana Valley.
					Two letters awaited me.&quot; I shall write them on the next boat.</p>
            <p>This morning I had services in English. There were a few village natives there.
					There is no interpreter here so I found it quit difficult, and do not know what
					I shall do this winter I preached to them in English, of course, on the first
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">words</unclear> of the Gospel for
					today &quot;No man can serve two masters etc.</p>
            <p>This evening I taught the large boys and girls in Sunday school and found it most
					interesting. I love these people.</p>
            <p>At evening service I baptized Eva Henry Savage&apos;s little girl Helen Elizabeth
					and <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Nena</unclear> Frank and Mose John
					were God mother and Father. There were only a few present. It is sad to see so
					few when I think of the crowd that use to be present. The white town has
					certainly corrupted this village and the flu has depleted it. May God speak
					through my lips to steer these people to their obligation to themselves. They
					need his guidance and help.</p>

            <p>Nenana clear and beautiful.</p>
            <p>This has been a fuller day and work begins to pile up. My time here is going to
					be crowded.</p>
            <p>A talk with Miss Wright to-day reveiled the reason for <del type="overstrike" hand="lw">f</del> my cold re-ception upon my arrival. She dreaded my coming
					because of the fact that I had <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">the</unclear> discipline of the children when here before. She is beginning
					to warm up a bit now. In all probability things may be pleasant enough.</p>
            <p>This is labour day but I have given it little thought. My greatest joy is that
					Papa and Roy and Howard have a holiday. Perhaps Mamma and Rosa and Mildred have
					gone out somewhere. Walter and his family when they rest they work there is no
					rest for them. I pray God He will provide some way for them that the children
					may be in school this year.</p>
            <p>School for the kiddies started to-day and they seem quite happy. I believe Miss
					Nixon is going to get on fine with them. They are a fine lot of children in
					every way.</p>

            <p>&quot;Oh for the life of a fireman&quot; Dick Albert said yesterday that Dick

            <p>Dick Ketzler &amp; Bonita <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Dick</unclear>
					Albert and Titus John came up just before dinner today and I refused flatly with
					definite reasons for the welfare of the native people at heart to marry them. I
					hate to see the wedge that is an entrance by which many may come in. Titus, to
					be relieved of the responsibility of his old mother, urged the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">pont</unclear> They went immediately to the
					commissioner to get the liscense <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">and</unclear> for him to marry to marry them. After I buried Samuel Titus

						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">unwilling</unclear> to consider the
					missionaries the natural guardians of the native people as they have always been
					so considered and granted them the license. As a matter of duty and policy (I am
					sorry to say &quot;policy&quot;) I married them. The first wedding <del type="overstrike" hand="lw">ever per</del> ceremony I ever performed. I
					hope the last will not be under such deplorable conditions.</p>
            <p>Until the natives themselves have the back-bone to start on their own feet there

            <p>This attitude seems a queer thing and I do not quite understand it. I still hope

            <p>Well, another day has gone by and I have accomplished something. The mail came in

            <p>Miss Wright seems very tired almost worn down. It is sad that Miss Bridge-man

            <p>Nenana clear &amp; colder.</p>
            <p>This has been a right full day but I have been able to study more. This morning I
					went down town but no mail came in on the &quot;Tanana&quot; last night. There
					was nothing through from the outside.</p>
            <p>This after noon the boys went up the Juliu Creek for a hunt to come back tomorrow
					night.</p>
            <p>I wrote my sermon but not in <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">toto</unclear>. Miss Nixon came over to the cabin and sat for quite a
					while.</p>
            <p>Evening service we had in the mission and there were quite a few up from the
					village we fixed up an alter with my cross &amp; candles and I wore my
					vestments.</p>
            <p>Many thoughts of home have come to me of Mildred and her dear family and Walter
					and his family Roy &amp; his family and Howard <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Margat</unclear> and Peggy. Dear Mother Rosa &amp; Papa are always
					on my mind too. God bless and help them always and keep them safe from all
					danger.</p>

            <p>Nenana very cold because of wind</p>
            <p>Most all morning and part of the after noon I read and studied and worked on my
					sermon for tomorrow such as it is. After I cleaned the house well I went down
					town and after attending to a bit of business in connection with the beautiful
					celtic cross to be placed at the head of the archdeacons grave I placed the
					order for the form in M<emph>r</emph> Nelsons hands who works at Burgmans
					shop. I believe he will do it well. Then I went out to call on M<emph>r</emph>
               <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Truffle</unclear> at his new house.</p>
            <p>This afternoon I took more of a bath in a tub and feel some cleaner to say the
					least. These sponge baths I dont like them.</p>
            <p>This evening I had a long talk with Miss Wright after the children had gone to
					bed. I like her. She knows her work and really has a brilliant mind. She is fine
					in every way and very different from the way I expected to find her.</p>
            <p>May God bless our work here and I hope He may be pleased that I shall be ordained
					on St Andrew&apos;s Day this year. I shall probably hear from the Bp on
					Tuesday.</p>

            <p>This has been a busy day. Joe tried to interpret the <del type="overstrike" hand="lw">service</del> sermon this morning, but he was not very successful.
					He was eager to try though and I think with practice he will be able to do it
					well by and by. I shall get somem village boys to work with him. Charlie Albert
					and perhaps Dick Albert Dick does very well but I dont know just how much he
					understands.</p>
            <p>Chief Thomas came up this afternoon and we talked over the affairs of the
					village. He is certainly a glib talker and says things when he talks. I wish he
					would put them into execution. We talked of the potlatch to be at Christmas and
					I have promised him some financial help for his house. I also arranged to buy
					the old Skookum house for a work shop and we will use the present blacksmith
					shop for a coal house. I encouraged the chief to urge his people to marry. The
					men not married to marry the women maiden and widow. Then to reconstruct their
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">laus</unclear>. To get team work in
					the village and to get the people out into the hills. I hope he will really do
					things but I never expect too much of these people as the first Christian borne
					generation.</p>
            <p>No service this evening for no one came. I am sorry.</p>
            <p>Charlie Smith and Silas went off <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">hinting</unclear> &amp; Miss W. had to discipline them.</p>
            <p>Mr &amp; M<emph>rs</emph> Phillips came to get us to send the larger girls

            <p>This morning I put the celery in boxes and into the cellar. It may be too late

            <p>While walking Nena<del type="overstrike" hand="lw">na</del> came up and told
					me that <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Jaime</unclear> Syling wanted to
					marry her. This presents the most difficult case of all as she has a husband. He
					is here staying at the cabin tonight. How I dread the sad outlook of these poor

					and he seems to be a good churchman save for his desire to marry a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">deorcded</unclear> native God save thy people.
					For I know that thou lovest them.</p>
            <p>This after noon after a little study we worked in the cellar. I am now I hope to
					go to Fairbanks. This question of Nena however may keep me. There is nothing so
					sad and depress-ing as to see these natives <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Gudustly</unclear> marrying white men and the sad thing is they
					desire it. It is too bad.</p>

            <p>This afternoon Miss Wright and I <del type="overstrike" hand="lw">came</del>
					went over the river and climbed to the top of the hill to get out of the sordid

					though I do not expect too much of them I am trying to appeal to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Jennie</unclear> from the Christian point of

            <p>This morning Miss W. and I went down town and tended to some business. I found

            <p>I have not felt well to day and I am sorry, but soon I shall be all right.</p>
            <p>This afternoon we finished the cellar and almost finished banking the big house.
					There is much to be done about the place and I hate to feel under the

            <p>At Prayers tonight I read the Gospel for the day. I wish I could have been in

            <p>I went down town this afternoon and found much to my astonishment that the form

					taking advantage of the situation but there is no help for it now. It will go up

            <p>There was no outside mail and consequently nothing from the Bp. But in my heart I

            <p>Mr Touffle came up for dinner tonight He is certainly pleasant. The kind of a

					better. I believe that men can be friends with men in a very real and perfect
					way if a pure, kind, and thoughtful relation exists as friends. Perhaps better
					sometimes than men and women for there is no lust of the flesh to lead astray.

            <p>We talked with Mr Gelcher about installing a bath room where the pantry now is.

            <p>It was in a way a pleasure to find the snow this morning but I realized that it
					would probably melt during the day and the cold weather on top of it would make
					banking impossible my cabin is not banked and I shall suffer this winter if I am
					not able to do it later.</p>
            <p>I am going to Fairbanks Friday and I must prepare a sermon so my time is going to
					be full taken until then. I hope I can get this house chinked and plastered is
					very urgent that I do.</p>
            <p>Most of the day spent at the house working on the cellar door. Saturday though so
					a busy day and many other things have come up.</p>
            <p>My freight from Seattle came this evening and I am glad to have my flashlight,
					gun thermos bottles etc. The box I shall use for another larger section for my
					bookcases and make three tiers of <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">these
						sections cachared</unclear> then I will have books to spare I hope to be
					able to do a good deal of reading this winter.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow I shall try to give an extemp sermon on prayer. I pray God that to His
					glory I may be ordained on St Andrew&apos;s Day</p>

            <p>Tonight we had a meeting of the village people in the schoolhouse about twenty
					were there counting women and children. I tried to get every body to work on
					chief Thomas house. I&apos;ll declare there are such funny people. They are just
					children They offer a sick back for an excuse for work and want to borrow money
					on it. Then they go down and gamble it away The evils of this world certainly
					lure them astray But I must remind myself again of the fact that not much can be
					expected of them. They want electric lights in the cabin. I admit they will be
					more sanitary but I suppose they will want telephones next. Civilization is a
					cruel intrusion on their simple life. There is much to be done.</p>

            <p>A big mail came this afternoon and I was glad to hear from home as well as

            <p>This afternoon M<emph>r</emph> Patterson came and he was certainly a queer

					good. There was only <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Bettes</unclear> at
					Evening service. The natives do not feel the same responsibility for Christian

					the village away They might attempt to follow us but Thank goodness that s not

            <p>I also spoke to him about studying for the ministry. I shall not press it too

					grounding is very good and he has a good mind but a bit slow. I am deedunply
					interested in him and his wellfare and sincerely hope it will be possible for
					him to go &quot;outside&quot; to Mt Hermon. He deserves it and I hope will be
					able to go and make good. God grant His blessings on the boy. There is much he
					can accomplish if he sets himself to it.</p>

            <p>This morning I went down town and attended to a good bit of business. I sent off

               <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Dunbans</unclear> in F&apos;b&apos;ks. and
					ordered Miss Nixon&apos; report cards. They will be $7<emph>50</emph> for
					500.</p>
            <p>This afternoon I wrote to Dad and corrected the childrens S.S. papers they were
					very good and most interesting. Luke <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Jimie</unclear> came to borrow $10<emph>00</emph> and I let him have
						$7<emph>50</emph>. Justin Silas may take a contract for 150 cords of
					wood. I hope he does.</p>
            <p>Moses and I did more work in class this evening and really accomplished something
					in math and English. He is an interesting chap and I believe will accomplish a
					good deal through the year. We hope to have more time for study as the works
					gets up and there is less to do. These next few days we will try to finish it
					all.</p>

            <p>This morning I got an awful knock on my leg just above the knee and if Moses had

            <p>I had intended going to the dance but had to ask Frank Touffle to come up and
					take Miss Nixon I am rather glad I did not have to go.</p>
            <p>Moses and I studied until 11:30 and I feel quite happy that we accomplished so
					much.</p>
            <p>That miserable pump is a trial. It has taken so much time.</p>
            <p>Miss W. spent the afternoon here and rested. we had tea and talked over a good
					many points in life. She is in-teresting and quite a deep thinker. I enjoy
					talking with her.</p>
            <p>The <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">chiffineers</unclear> came down from
					Fairbanks and a dresser for the cabin. M<emph>rs</emph> Clegg was very

            <p>This morning I felt blue and took a walk to the woods. This afternoon I felt

            <p>This was the first night of skating and it was fine to see them all out on the

					However we accomplished a good deal. He can write &quot;The Crossing of the

            <p>I am thinking of those dear loved ones at home tonight and Pray Gods blessing on

            <p>All day I have studied save for a few minutes that I helped fix the pump and it

					while the family were skating. No word from the Bp and a remark Miss N. made as

					going to ordain me. Of course I am sorry but it is all right. I changes my plans
					very much as to my work and future <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">life
						I</unclear> fear. His disinterest towards me in contrast to the archdeacon
					is very unhappily noticable However.</p>
            <p>Moses and I had a lesson tonight and a good one. I love the boy. We talked a
					while after it. He said he had a fight with seven men who tried to make him

            <p>Miss W. has been in the cabin all day for she was not feeling well. It is strange

					all times.</p>
            <p>This afternoon I worked a bit in the back room cleaning it up then wrote eight
					letters I am glad to have off. I shall try to write up all my mail hereafter as
					it comes in. Otherwise it gets so far behind.</p>
            <p>I have not written <del type="overstrike" hand="lw">to</del> my sermon for

            <p>This has been a hard day and I have not felt very happy. Miss W. talks of having

					seems like the bottom is going to drop out of everything. Moses has been a bit
					un-happy too.</p>
            <p>I mailed 15 letters tonight and hope to get a good many done through the coming
					week now that the outside work is lightening up.</p>
            <p>The boys had a feed tonight and invited me we had a very nice time being foolish

            <p>This afternoon after Sunday School I rested for I was very tired.</p>

					She seems to be much distressed about many things and I am sorry.</p>
            <p>Moses went down after some moccasins this evening and of course we missed most of
					the lesson we should have had. I have not decided in my mind altogether yet just
					how he feels about study but am very much inclined to think that he is not so

            <p>This afternoon Miss Wright and I went down town. She came over and stayed a

            <p>M<emph>rs</emph> Clegg wrote to Miss Nixon urging her to come up Miss W.

            <p>The Churchman of Sept 24<emph>th</emph>, I think, gave M<emph>r</emph>

            <p>I went to the R. C. Church this morning and it seemed very peculiar in some ways
					How remarkable that the Priest has such a strong hold on the people when the
					mission so far separated from the people The Priest mumbled away in an undertone
					in Latin which the choir sang and I can understand while there is so much
					superstition among them. He <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">announced</unclear> All Saints Day and said that all who did not have
					pressing business <emph>will</emph> be there. It reminded me of army
					days.</p>
            <p>His sermon was poor. Very bad grammar and much repetion but he kept close to the
					N.T. and did not preach the RC Church. His vestments were almost ridiculous,
					lace from the hips down and carelessly worn. The Chasuable was not pointed in
					the back and resembled a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">carpowters</unclear> apron in front. Oh, yes, one <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">pont</unclear> he made in his sermon address it
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">was</unclear> was that Jesus wept but
					never laughed according to Bible pointing to His sympathy with humanity.
					Certainly, however, in a natural relationship with him He must have laughed many
					times</p>
            <p>This afternoon I decorated the Masonic ballroom for the ball tomorrow night and
					had a big time. It looked quite suitable for an Halloween ball and quite
					festive</p>
            <p>I was at the Hicks&apos; for dinner, and it was certainly delightful. I am very
					much interested in them and hope all goes well with them. God be in <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">them</unclear> home and bless them wherever
					they are.</p>

            <p>This afternoon M<emph>rs</emph> Clegg and I took down the decorations and

            <p>The marshal comes down to dinner and I am glad to have this chance to get to know

            <p>I had hoped to get a good deal done while here but find I am unable to accomplish

            <p>M<emph>rs</emph> Clegg&apos;s fine. She is most thoughtful and kind most

            <p>No word from the Bp The time is short and it looks that I will not be ordained I

            <p>I am glad to be back again and find much work to be done. Much cor-respondence

            <p>Chief Thomas came down. I shall see him in the morning.</p>
            <p>We are getting in to Adam Bede now and Moses is enjoying it.</p>
            <p>Miss Nixon announces that Drane will be back in the Spring. I had hoped that I

            <p>M<emph>rs</emph> Clegg came down today and I am sorry I did not get down to

					and M<emph>r</emph> Bleeker. I like M<emph>rs</emph> Clegg. very
					much. She is fine. She seemed to like Moses very much and is anxious to help

					Moses is polishing up nicely I hope it will be possible for him to go out next
					year. To Hermon though I do not like Mt Hermon at all.</p>
            <p>Miss Nixon Miss Bridgeman and I went to the dance tonight. It was right good and
					I enjoyed it. They have a good floor. I suppose I should give more time to the

            <p>The work is growing heavier now, but I am enjoying it.</p>
            <p>I am sorry I shall not be ordand on St Andrews day I wish I could. If I am not

            <p>All day I have been working about the place. Sometimes here and sometimes at the

            <p>The mail tonight brought a nice letter from Mother. I am glad she has <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">luislim</unclear> in the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Riticha</unclear> and the back steps fixed. I

            <p>Nenana Cloudy. windy.</p>
            <p>This has been a day full of small duties and happines than the past week though
					no <del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">less</del> more occupied. I tried to
					write my sermon <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">ofoe</unclear> Tanana and
					found it difficult but have made some progress. Little by little I am learning
					the causes of the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">effidstial</unclear>
					have been so distressing. It is only when we submit our wills entirely to
					God&apos;s will that that peace comes that <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">pooreth</unclear> under-standing.</p>
            <p>Moses &amp; Dick broke in the dogs today and they are a live team. I wish I could
					anticipate the trips I have to make this winter. The work is sometimes most
					disheartening and I am sorry I am so unfit for it.</p>
            <p>I sent an afidavit to the Sand Office in Fairbanks today saying that we would cut
					wood only for the Warrior on the land for which the Permit is granted. This
					relieves our paying <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Shurparge</unclear>
					which would amount to $60 or $75.</p>
            <p>A big mail comes in tomorrow and I am glad. I hope some money comes with I expect
					the Bps. letter also.</p>

            <p>This morning I went over with Dick and M<emph>r</emph> MacIntosh to find
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Lesuwre leen</unclear> and post the

					it <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">comscts with</unclear> this other patch
					by which I posted the notice.</p>
            <p>Miss W. took church service as I got back late. After Dinner M<emph>rs</emph> Clegg phoned and I went down to see her &amp; the Judge.</p>
            <p>A mail came in and a latter from the Bp. included to applicatons which I shall
					fill out and have signed. I wired Judge Clegg to see if he would be willing to
					have <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">expestrymn</unclear> sign it and
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Rev Edin</unclear> Hughes to see if he

            <p>Johnnie Campbells Road House clear.</p>
            <p>This has been a day filled with anxieties and fears with Joys and glad
					anticipations. As I held the handle bars of that sled for a large part of the
					day I could not help but think of the Arch-deacon and Walter. For many years he
					drove it. I thought of him in his anxieties and fears, of his distress and
					anguish of the Spirit of the hopes and ambitions, and of Walter&apos;s
					kindliness and amiability. What a pleasure it is to be making this trip.</p>
            <p>Miss W. Nixon, and B. were up to see us off They were very kind.</p>
            <p>The whole trip was a hard one. The newly broken in dogs were tired and Moses
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">brood sholder</unclear> to a rope
					attatched to the tow line I pushed on the handle bars.</p>
            <p>We did not stop at the native village as we<del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">re</del> were late and did not get in here until six oclock.</p>
            <p>There was a good supper shortly after we got off our wet clothes and fixed the

            <p>At 7:15 we started studying. Moses read some &quot;Adam Bede&quot; and took a
