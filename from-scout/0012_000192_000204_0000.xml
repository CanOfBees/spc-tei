               <note type="abstract">Watson B. Smith wrote to his father on Dec. 20, 1863 while serving in the Civil War. He told him about the Battle of Bean&apos;s Station and how the Union cavalry was forced back. He felt they were now reinforced and could whip the South. He felt the South gained no advantage except for occupation at Bean&apos;s Station. He told his father he was addressing his letters incorrectly. He had not advanced to Capt. as his father addressed his letters. He asked his father if he had received letters from 2 generals in regards to his commission. He said he would write more later since his carpet bag was in Knoxville. He said he was well. He stated he doubted they would go to Kentucky unless the general desired to go there.</note>

            <p>Blaine X Roads Dec. 20. 1863</p>
            <p>Dear Father</p>
            <p>We about about 4 hrs. fight with the enemy at <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Beans</unclear> Sta. &amp; then fell back to this place. We have been reinforced &amp; can whip the enemy now. the enemy gained no advantage save <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">position</unclear> &amp; Beans Sta.</p>
            <p>I see you address my letters to Capt. Smith. I am still 1st St. Acting Asst. Adjt Genl. Have not you recd. my letters enclosing Genl. Sanders &amp; Genl. Whites letters in regard to my commission?</p>
            <p>I shall write a long letter as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>My Carpet Bag is at Knoxville.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="0012_000192_000204_0002.jpg" xml:id="d3e184"/>
            <p>I am very well.</p>
            <p>
               <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">It</unclear> does not look as much like going to Ky. now as it did - still I think we will as Genl. Sturgis our Corps Commander desires it.</p>
            <p>I have <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">recd.</unclear> a lot of papers from home lately. Also letters from Mother &amp; Mary.</p>
            <p>With much love</p>
            <p>Watson</p>
