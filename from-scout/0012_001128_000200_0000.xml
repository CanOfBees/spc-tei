            <p>PASTED ON INSIDE FRONT COVER</p>
            <p>[newspaper clipping]</p>
            
                     <p>BRUISED, NOT BROKEN.</p>
                     <p>&quot;And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
								shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall
								there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.&quot;
								Rev. 21, 4.</p>
                     <p>From out the depths profound of bitter anguish, Through tears, oh
								God, I lift my eyes to thee; Thy tearless eyes see where the smitten
								languish; From heaven, thy far off heaven, where all is bliss, One
								pitying look, Creator, turn on me.</p>
                     <p>As fugitives and vagabonds we wander, Thine erring children, exiled
								far away; Our sins and miseries in gloom we ponder, The death-brand
								on ourselves and all we love, Through darkness watching for the
								break of day.</p>
                     <p>With sobbing wretchedness, our best affection We bury from our sight,
								and helpless grope Where Death holds fondest hearts in grim
								subjection, Mid that drear stillness longing for one voice, One
								balm, one whisper, that might thrill new hope.</p>
                     <p>Yet near the grave&apos;s shut door I still must linger;
								Eternity&apos;s closed portal; gate of heaven; Oh! rend the stone,
								redeemer! With thy finger! Let me look through and see my loved with
								thee! The words once let me hear, &quot;Redeemed!
								Forgiven!&quot;</p>
                     <p>The wind, while gently now the long grass bending With billowy
								undulations, ebbs and flows; Now, to the trees, like unseen giant
								lending A strength sublime, they toss their mighty shades, And where
								&apos;twas dank and dark, a sunbeam glows.</p>
                     <p>The unseen wind still &quot;bloweth where it listeth;&quot; Spirit
								divine! disperse this sullen gloom; Oh breathe that breath which on
								one e&apos;er resisteth; Down through the rifted sky thy radiance
								pour, And waft my heart and faith above the tomb.</p>
                     <p>&quot;My child! thou hast mistaken all thy story; No fugitive, no
								vagabond art thou; Yet but a little while I screen my glory;
								Baptized in grief, thy heaven shall open soon; My Dove is lighting
								on thee, even now!</p>
                     <p>Before the sepulchre, the great stone lying, Soon, for thy coming,
								shall be rolled away, and thou shalt enter, not to doubts and
								crying, but loved and loving, holy and serene, Translated to my home
								and endless day.&quot;</p>
                  <p>THE FIRST GREEN LEAF.</p>
                     <p>By Mattie Winfield.</p>
                     <p>&apos;Tis a tiny little thing, Herald of the coming spring; First to
								burst its winding sheet, First the balmy spring to greet, Bravely
								ushered into life &apos;Mid the elemental strife, Nurtured well by
								wind and storm, Which assailed its outer form.</p>
                     <p>Deftly shaped and folded well, It has lain within its cell Through
								the long and dreary time, Whilst the winter ruled the clime; Fast
								asleep and dreaming oft Of the blue sky up aloft, Of the sun which
								soon should fall Warm and lightsome over all:</p>
                     <p>Dreaming of the summer rain, Falling soft o&apos;er hill and plain;
								Of the balmy zephyr&apos;s sigh, And the south wind stealing by; Of
								the sweetest odors breathed Where the summer flowers are wreathed
								Dreaming thus, with its cell, Folded close and guarded well.</p>
                     <p>But there came a magic word, And its little heart was stirred With a
								wish for liberty; So it struggled to be free Till the bonds which
								held it broke And the tiny leaf awoke, And a world, untried and new
								Burst upon its startled view.</p>
                     <p>So I plucked it from the bough, Placed it where it greets me now. As
								I gaze upon it here, Soft it whispers in my ear: Spring is coming!
								soon her voice Shall the waiting earth rejoice; Soon with bird, and
								bee, and flower, She shall charm each passing hour.</p>
                     <p>Spring is coming! Let the strain Fall upon my ear again: Let the
								silent air be stirred By the magic of the word. Spring is coming!
								Spring is here! Lo! her vernal robes appear, For this tiny, winsome
								thing Is the first green leaf of spring.</p>
                  <p>THE TWILIGHT OPPORTUNITY.</p>
                     <p>What loving mother does not know value of the twilight hour, when
								children tired of play, or interrupted in chosen amusements by the
								waning light unconsciously attracted to her side by cheerful
								fireside&apos;s glow? The day&apos;s boisterous mirth is subdued and
								the troubles <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> disappointments of the
								day are softened <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> forgotten in this
								charmed hour. Mother <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> Admonition is
								then more tenderly given, more gently received; and the little sec
									<gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> and confessions, which might
								shrink <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> daylight, are now confidingly
								poured into <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> loving ear.</p>
                     <p>HEAVEN.</p>
                     <p>The golden palace of my God Towering above the clouds I see; Beyond
								the cherub&apos;s bright abode, Higher than angels&apos; thoughts
								can be. How can I in those courts appear Without a wedding garmet
								on? Conduct me, thou Life-giver, there, Conduct me to thy glorious
								throne! And clothe me with thy robes of light, And lead me through
								sin&apos;s darksome night My saviour and god. -Russian Poetry</p>
                     <p>SEE the ice, how hard it is! But two o&apos;clock comes, there is a
								great heat<gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> the sun, and the ice melts
								and cracks; but <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> the sun goes down,
								and at night it is as hard <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> ever. How
								often is it so under the influe<gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> of
								instruction! A powerful appeal often produces a melting of the
								heart; the tears ap<gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> rently of
								contrition, flow; but the instruct <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/>
								ended, the tears are dried up, and the <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> becomes as hard as ever</p>
                     <p>The fellow who had deserted from wives and four regiments, thinks
								that, <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> of being tried as a deserter,
								he should <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> given for those first few
								offences</p>
                     <p>An old bachelor says that marriage <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/>
								instituted for no other purpose than to <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> vent the men from sleeping diagon <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/>
								bed.</p>
                     <p>The boy who drives a flock of geese is q <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> as respectable a quill-driver&quot; as most vot <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> of pen and ink.</p>
                     <p>Inscription For A Watch</p>
                     <p>Could but our tempers move like this machine, Nor urged by passion,
								nor delayed by spleen; And true to nature&apos;s regulating power,
								By virtuous acts distinguish every hour: Then health and joy would
								follow, as they ought, The laws of motion and the laws of thought;
								Sweet health to pass the present moments o&apos;er, And everlasting
								joy when time shall be no more.</p>
                     <p>We wish to close our eyes upon the world in the places we love best;
								the child in its mother&apos;s bosom, the patriot in his
								country.</p>
                     <p>A beautiful sentiment is the following, by the celebrated
								Logan:-&quot;Over all the move- ments of life, religion scatters her
								favors, but reserves the choicest, her diving blessing, for the last
								hour.&quot;</p>

            <p>DARK HOURS.</p>
                     <p>Ah, who can know the yearning Of the sorrow-stricken heart, As it
								finds at every turning Fresh cause for deeper smart! The hopes long
								years have cherished, And nurtured many a day, By one fell stroke
								have perished, Though seeming bright and gay.</p>
                     <p>When prompted by ambition, To gain some promised end, Just at the
								full fruition, Some ruder blast may rend The idol of our being From
								out our tightened grasp, And in the distance seeing, Have compassed
								seas to clasp:</p>
                     <p>Like one in silent slumbers, Who finds a mansion bright, Where
								music&apos;s flowing numbers, And heaven&apos;s purest light, And
								flowers of beauty rarest, In spring&apos;s eternal green-- From
								this, of visions fairest, He wakes to know the dream.</p>
                     <p>But hope in winning measures Would point to realms above, Where
								ever-during pleasures And God&apos;s abiding love For him of life so
								weary Are kept in precious store: And though this life is dreary,
								There&apos;s rest forever more.</p>

                  <p>WHEN?</p>
                     <p>BY GEORGE H. COOMER</p>
                     <p>When shall mad convulsions cease When the better days being-- Into
								knowledge, into peace, Melting ignorance and sin?</p>
                     <p>We have listened year on year, Hopefully the old refrain: &apos;Be, O
								man! of happy cheer, For the Eden comes again!&apos;</p>
                     <p>But like waves that seem to run, While succeeding waves recur, Our
								delusive glories done, Sink we ever where we were</p>
                     <p>Always leave we, when we leap Higher than our common main, Equal
								chasms in our deep, That must swallow us again!</p>
                     <p>Never stream o&apos;ertops it source, Never fruit belies its tree; As
								our compass, so our course; As our nature, so are we.</p>
                     <p>Dim the path and dark the view; Hence our stumblings cannot cease,
								Till the spirit bloom anew, In the gentle world of peace.</p>
                     <p>From the Front.</p>
                     <p>We received the following from a soldier at the front yesterday:</p>
                     <p>We are having a big fight, and driving the &quot;critters&quot; like
								fun. They dispute every inch of ground. Are now within one and one
								half miles of Marietta, the rebs holding Kenesaw Mountain. They have
								evacuated some of the best works I ever saw, within the last three
								days. They think Sherman is h--l on <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">flanking</unclear>
                     </p>
                     <p>MORNING.</p>
                     <p>FROM rounded hills and impling vales Night&apos;s shadowy shrouds
								unfold, And the lonely star of morning pales, And the mists are
								bathed in gold.</p>
                     <p>Soft zephyrs are breathing from the west Over the rippling corn, And
								the ruby kiss of the sun is prest On the white brow of the morn.</p>
                     <p>The flowers shake off their dewy sleep, And their petaled eyes
								unclose With innocent looks on the calm blue deep, That curtains
								their repose.</p>
                     <p>From nestling home all leaf-embowered, The birds pour <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">many</unclear> songs, And fields
								and river banks are showered With new-born insect throngs.</p>
                     <p>All things are glad at the wakening breath That heraldeth the day,
								When sleep, so nearly akin to death, Passeth upon its way:</p>
                     <p>The sweet foreshadowing of that waking When under heavenly skies,
								While the morn of another life is breaking, We shall open these
								darkened eyes.</p>
                  <p>&quot;Miss Dubois, what is your opinion of the weather? I think it
								intends to clear. Do you agree with me?&quot;--&quot;I do, indeed;
								and wish some folks would follow the weather&apos;s example, and
								clear, too.&quot; Mr. Scofield seized his hat, and has not been seen
								in that street since.</p>

                     <p>THE VOW.</p>
                     <p>One rosy morn in summer time, Beneath you linden tree, My Harold
								pressed me to his heart With knightly courtesy.</p>
                     <p>His gallant plume waved in the breeze His sword was on his thigh, He
								looked the very god of war Though love beamed from his eye.</p>
                     <p>&quot;I go,&quot; he said, &quot;where glory calls &quot;But tell me,
								ere we part, &quot;Dost thou pledge to me for weal or woe &quot;Thy
								gently maiden heart?</p>
                     <p>&quot;Dost give to me this little hand? &quot;Wilt ever constant be?
								&quot;And dost thou promise me to wait &quot;Till I return to
								thee?&quot;</p>
                     <p>He bent his head yet nearer mine-- I whispered low the vow; One
								silent tear rolled down his cheek And fell upon my brow.</p>
                     <p>He pressed me closer to his heart, Then hurried down the lane-- I
								little thought that day, alas! He&apos;d ne&apos;er come back
								again.</p>
                     <p>But every day at even tide, I kneel beneath you tree, And humbly
								breath afresh my vow, &quot;To ever constant be.&quot;</p>

                     <p>BY THEODORE TILTON.</p>
                     <p>O Thou before whose Throne we fall, Who bendest to the bended knee,
								Who spurnest none, who lovest all,-- How long O God, from land and
								sea, Shall yet the groaning nations call?</p>
                     <p>O Thou by whom the lost are found, Whose Cross, upraised, forever
								stands, When shall its shadow on the ground Spread East and West
								through all the lands, Until it gird the world around?</p>
                     <p>O Thou who makest kingdoms Thine, When shall Thy mighty arms outreach
								From Southern palm to Northern pine, To bind each human heart to
								each, And each to Thee as branch to vine?</p>
                     <p>O Thou who cleansest human sin, For whom the whole creation waits,
								When shall Thy reign on earth begin?-- O be ye lifted up, ye gates,
								And let the King of Glory in.</p>

            <p>A MONODY OF LIFE</p>
                     <p>To him who righty scans his life Reviewing deeds and years, How vast
								its sum of evil seems! How small its good appears.</p>
                     <p>Evil looms up a forest dark Of thrifty Upas trees; Good seems a
								feeble undergrowth Imps might uproot with ease.</p>
                     <p>Our hearts are garners, whence we sow The fields of life with seed,
								Each of the readiest to grow, Grows up an evil deed.</p>
                     <p>I gather all my flock of deeds-- The least, the most remote-- Each
								noble one I call a sheep, Each evil one a goat.</p>
                     <p>Then, like a shepherd, carefully The herd I separate, And first,
								place every beast of vice With its own vicious mate.</p>
                     <p>Now unto these I say &quot;Depart! And having fixed their doom, I
								turn to greet my goodly sheep With &quot;All ye blessed,
								come!&quot;</p>
                     <p>Lo! a few sickly dwarfish things With me as sheep abide, While all
								the strongest of my flock Are on the vicious side.</p>
                     <p>&quot;Trust in the Lord and aye do good, A bard inspired hath said,
								&quot;So shalt thou dwell within the land And, verily, shalt be
								fed.&quot;</p>
                     <p>Why am I spared? not Godly trust Detains me from the grave; Why am I
								fed? not doing good Secures the bread I have.</p>
                     <p>But of thy mercy, Lord it is That I am not consumed, That I have days
								of grace instead Of being dead and doomed.</p>

                     <p>BY JULIE LEONARD.</p>
                     <p>Far from the sound of distant rushing battle, Far from that sound!
								Yet do I dream of fife and drumbeat&apos; rattle Over the ground;
								Seeing the starry flag its folds out-flinging Upon the breeze,
								Hearing the sound of martial voices ringing Among the trees.</p>
                     <p>The clattering tramp of many chargers prancing That heavy tread, The
								glittering light of shining bayonets glancing Above the dead. The
								shouts, the shrieks, the groans of deadly anguish Break on the ear;
								While on the upturned face of dead and dying The sun shines
								clear.</p>
                     <p>I do not love to read the dark dim future, Even in dreams; Above the
								cloud that lowers o&apos;er our country The light still gleams. And
								in the hand of Him who yet reigns o&apos;er us I rest in peace,
								Trusting that in no distant time before us This war will cease.</p>
                     <p>PARTING.</p>
                     <p>AN OLD GERMAN FOLK-SONG.</p>
                     <p>MORROW must I forth from here, Forth at dawn to-morrow; All too soon
								doth morning come, Seems it wings to borrow. Home to leave is sad I
								find, But my Love to leave behind, This is saddest sorrow!</p>
                     <p>When two folks are right good friends, They will quarrel never; Sun
								and moon would first fall out, Ere such friends would sever. How
								much worse is then the smart, When two loving hearts must part, Part
								perhaps for ever.</p>
                     <p>Kiss thee on the hands or cheeks, Little breezes playing; Think that
								these are sighs of mine, Out strange lands here straying. Thousands
								send I daily out, Which go float the house about, Where my Love is
								staying.</p>
                     <p>Don&apos;t undertake to use big words with-out being first sure as
								the exact calibre of your mouth.</p>
                     <p>It is a rare thing for a man or woman to be in love with more than
								one at a time. Love sometimes carries double, but not often.</p>
                     <p>Posthumous charities are the very essence of selfishness when
								bequeathed by those who, when alive, would part with nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                        <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/> THEY HEAR OF THIS AT HOME?</p>
                     <p>THE battle trembled in the scale! Charge followed charge through
								smoke and fire. Strong men stood deathly still and pale, To see the
								rebel lines grow nigher! Our colonel, brave as brave could be, Rode
								down our line through showers of flame, And shouted, &quot;Comrades,
								will you see Your well-worn colors blush with shame?&quot;</p>
                     <p>His voice closed up the broken line, And from our ranks a stripling
								flew, He said, &quot;The task alone be mine To plant our honored
								flag anew!&quot; Then with a cheer he sped away, He seemed to spurn
								the ground beneath, And like a hunted stag at bay, He waved it in
								the traitors&apos; teeth.</p>
                     <p>A storm of bullets round him rained, As with a shout we onward
								pressed, But ere our patriot guide we gained The lifeblood stained
								his gallant breast. We raised him from the shell-ploughed sod, His
								white lips full with bloody foam, And heard amid his prayers to God,
								&quot;Oh! will they hear of this at home?&quot;</p>
                     <p>An expert seaman is tried in a tempest, runner in a race, a captain
								in a battle, a Christian in adversity.</p>

                     <p>BY ERNEST TREVOR.</p>
                     <p>THE air was clear and keen, before us flowed The lordly Hudson,
								silvered by the light Of the pale moon, which glid through silent
								night As one who treads a sorrow-touched abode And fears to wake the
								sleepers. Why did this Mute world which I a thousand times had seen
								Before without emotion wear a mien Which steeped my soul in soft
								entrancing bliss? Because I wandered with my heart&apos;s true
								queen, And she, all loving, leant upon my arm, Gazed in my eyes,
								and, with a smile serene, Looked those sweet thoughts which triumph
								over speech. From thee, my darling, came that wondrous charm, No
								thought can compass and no art can reach.</p>
                     <p>Affecting Scence.</p>
                     <p>On Thursday, says the Washington Chron-icle, while the wounded were
								being transfer-red from the steamers to the ambulances which were to
								convey them to the hospitals, a prominent lady from Michigan was
								observ-ed looking anxiously to ascertain if either of her sons were
								among the number. She soon espied one of them with his arm shot off
								above the wrist, and the blood still trickling down from it, sitting
								upon a coffin. &quot;Where is Charles?&quot; said she. &quot;In
								this,&quot; said the undaunted hero, pointing to his seat. The lady
								could not refrain from weeping, and many of those present were much
								affected by the grief of the mother. She had another son upon the
								battle field, from whom she could obtain no tidings.</p>
                     <p>A WHITE MAN TURNING BLACK.--The Philadelphia Age gives a long
								description of the sin-gular case of Gustavus Brest, a native of
								Germany, who has been in this country for 15 years, and for most of
								that time a workman in a cotton factory at Manayunk Pa. He is a
								single man, of temperate habits, and 45 years of age. In the autumn
								of 1861 he was taken with spotted fever, from which he recovered,
								and the spots disappeared in due time. In August last dark purple
								spots appeared on the back of each hand, and on each instep, giving
								no pain, but increasing in size until nearly the whole surface of
								the body has been covered with a bronze hue. His nose is as
								decidedly dark as the skin of an Abyssinian, his cheeks are more of
								a coffee color. The palms of his hands and the soles of his feet are
								as white as they ever were. His health is remarkably good--it never
								was better. Within the past month a deeper shade has been added to
								the skin. Neither the microscope nor the investi-gations of the most
								learned physicians have found any cause for this singular
								transformation.</p>
                  <p>SPIRITS AND ANGELS.</p>
                     <p>LONELY musing in the twilight, When the lengthening shadows fall,
								Spirits bright and holy Angels Come obedient to my call: Lost and
								loved ones gone before me, Phantoms fair from memory won, Seem to
								flit before my Fancy, Midway to the setting sun.</p>
                     <p>I can see them, robed in Beauty, Some rejoicing, some forlorn,
								Friendly all, and sent to guide me Out of Darkness into Morn. On the
								chimes I hear their voices Whispering solace form the skies. Holy
								Angels, hover near me! Fit my soul for Paradise!</p>

            <p>When his Majesty George IV. was in Edinburgh, and after he had held
								the levee, dressed, out of compliment to his northern subjects, in
								the garb of the Gael, it became a matter of etiquette discussion,
								whether or not it would be proper to hold the drawing room in the
								same uniform of plaid and kilt. The peeresses and other ladies held
								a council on the subject, at which opinions ran almost uni- versally
								against this mode of adorning the royal person. It was observed,
								however, that Lady H-had said nothing, and, as she had great
								influence, her judgement was solicited. &quot;Why,&quot; replied
								she, &quot;I am sorry, Ladies, to differ so much from all your
								sentiments; but it does appear to me that, as his majesty is to stay
								so short a while with us, we ought certainly to see as much of him
								as we can!&quot;</p>
                     <p>At a lively village in Illinois, they have a benevolent society, one
								of whose objects is to watch with and take care of its sick members.
								Last fall an unmarried young lady was admitted to membership. In a
								couple of months she was blessed with a bright-eyed babe, and was
								very sick. Some of the young lady members ex- pressed to the chief
								officer of the association thier duty to visit the unfortunate one.
								&quot;Well,&quot; said he, after much deliberation, &quot;I suppose
								not. You are not obliged to watch where there is a contagious
								disease.&quot;</p>

                     <p>A Kentucky correspondent sends us the following anecdote of a couple
								of thieves, who were a great annoy ance to the neighborhood of B---,
								in that State: One night they went to a house where they knew there
								was money. After much parleying as to who should go in, one of them
								named Bob, the junior of the two, vol unteered to try it. On raising
								the latch of the door, Bob made some noise, which awakened the old
								man, who was asleep in an adjoining room. The old man asked who it
								was, when Bob replied by mewing like a cat, which pacified the old
								man, and Bob succeeded in se curing some of the money, and retired,
								thinking he had done his share. After going back to where his
								compan- ion was waiting for him, he told him it was his turn now,
								and instructed him how to act if the old man should awake again.
								After the other thief had entered, he made some noise too, and the
								old man awoke the second time and called out, but Bob&apos;s
								companion, instead of mewing as Bob had done, replied, &quot;It&apos;s a
								cat!&quot; Reader imagine the <gap reason="indecipherable" resp="Henderson"/>

								horses in his country, mentioned that the celebrated Eclipse had run
								a mile in a minute. &quot;My good fellow!&quot; exclaimed an
								American present, &quot;that is less than the average rate of our
								common roadsters. I live in my country seat near Philadelphia, and
								when I ride in a hurry to town of a morning, my own shadow
								can&apos;t keep up with me, but generally comes into the warehouse
								to find me from a minute to a minute and a half after my arrival.
								One morning the beast was rest- less, and I rode him as hard as I
								could several times round a large factory, just to take the old
								Harry out of him. Well, sir, he went so fast that the whole time I
								saw my back directly before, and was twice in danger of riding over
								myself.&quot;</p>

                     <p>THE arrival of new conscripts gives rise to some fun in camp.
								Sometimes a fellow will be found who has re- enlisted and
								re-deserted many times--under different names, of course. The other
								day, a Sergeant of a com- pany of New York Volunteers was calling
								the roll: &quot;Peter O&apos;Shaughnessy?&quot; No answer.
								&quot;Peter O&apos;Shaughnessy?&quot; No answer. &quot;Peter

                     <p>MATRIMONIAL ILLUSTRATION.--A country girl, several of whose sisters
								had married badly, was about herself to take the noose. &quot;How
								dare you get married,&quot; asked a cousin of hers, &quot;after
								having before you the unfortunate example of your sisters?&quot;
								&quot;A fudge for the example of my sisters!&quot; exclaimed the
								girl, with spirit--&quot;I choose to make a trial myself. Did you
								ever see a parcel of pigs running to a trough of hot swill? The
								first one sticks in his nose, gets it scald- ed, and then draws back
								and squeals. The second burns his nose, and stands squealing in the
								same manner. The third follows suit, and he squeals too. But still
								it makes no difference with those behind. They never take warn- ing
								of those before; but all in turn thrust in their noses, just as if
								the first hadn&apos;t got burnt or squealed at all. So it is with
								girls in regard to matrimony, and now, cousin, I hope you are
								satisfied.&quot;</p>

								Republic is no more!&apos; &quot;The second is the wail of those
								true but faint hearts who also accepting as inevitable the ruin of

								head, Like some pale mourner, o&apos;er other brave ones dying.</p>

								group of soldiers knelt Around a comrade, lying calm and white, A
								stain of flowing blood upon his bayonet-belt; Close by him on the
								trampled meadow-grass, Beside his musket an unopened letter lay-- A
								message from the home which now, alas! Must be forever dark because
								of this sad day.</p>

                     <p>They read him, as he wished, the precious lines-- The words of love,
								of brave encouragement and cheer-- Read him how Mary, &apos;mid her
								household shrines, Was hopeful and content; how Baby, &quot;little
								dear,&quot; Had learned to walk; how Tom had won the prize At school
								last term; how he, the dear one far away, Was prayed for nightly;
								how with straining eyes They waited his return, as for a festal
								day.</p>
                     <p>They ceased. Upon the pallid, vacant face A deeper shadow fell, and
								with a weary cry The dying soldier sobbed: &quot;Give them Thy
								grace, O blessed Father; shield them till the storm goes by!&quot;
								His voice grew faint, then ceased--but one who bent Close to the
								fading lips heard this: &quot;Good-night, my dears,&quot; As if with
								death&apos;s cold chill and pains were blent Sweet memories of
								home--dreams of life&apos;s brighter years.</p>
                     <p>And still the battle throbbed along the hills, And still the dying
								and the dead in billows lay Along the slopes and by the crimson
								rills-- The night shades folding all in mantles dun and gray. There,
								where he fell, they scooped a shallow grave, And with her letter on
								his heart, so cald and calm, Left him to wait the roll-call of the
								brave, The summons to receive the victor&apos;s crown and palm.</p>
                     <p>Taking the Oath.</p>
                     <p>A gentleman informed us the other day that the following conversation
								recently took place in the office of the Provost Marshal. A well
								dressed lady entered the room and remarked: &quot;I wish to take the
								amnesty oath.&quot; &quot;Are you a loyal woman, madam?&quot;
								&quot;I suppose I am.&quot; &quot;Are you friendly to the Southern
								Confed- eracy?&quot; &quot;Indeed I am.&quot; &quot;Do you desire
								the rebels to succeed?&quot; &quot;I most assuredly do--I want to
								take the amnesty oath.&quot; And the oath was administered, and in
								the face of God and man this woman, to save her property we suppose,
								swore to a lie, and blackened her soul with perjury.</p>

            <p>There&apos;s a yellow rose in texas that I am going to see, no other darky knows
					her, no darky only me; She cried so when I left her, it like to broke my heart,

            <p>Chorus.</p>
            <p>She&apos;s the sweetest rose of color this darky ever knew. her Eyes as bright as
					diamonds, they sparkle like the dew you may talk about your dearest May &amp;
					sing of Rosy Lee, But the yellow rose of texas beats the Belle of Tenn.</p>
            <p>Where the Rio grande is flowing, &amp; the stormy skies are bright, She walks
					along the River in the quiet summer night, She says if I remember, when we
					parted long ago, I promised to come back again, and not leave her so.</p>
            <p>Chorus--She&apos;s the sweetest Rose of color &amp;c. O! now I&apos;m going to
					find her, for my heart is full of woe, and we&apos;ll sing the song together,
					that we sung so long ago, we&apos;ll play the Banjo galy, and we&apos;ll sing
					the songs of yore, And the yellow rose of Texas shall be mine forever more.
					Chorus--she&apos;s the sweetest rose of color &amp;c.</p>
