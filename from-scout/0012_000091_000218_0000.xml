               <note type="abstract">27 May 1865 David L. Jones in Nashville, Tenn. to his wife, Anna Jones in Allegheny City, Pa. Tells her that his letters may not be arriving as regularly. There are plans to move into a new barracks. Sneers at the talk of being paid soon. Believes it won&apos;t happen until they are &quot;mustered out.&quot; Wants to secretly send her some needed goods and tells her to sell his watch, if she needs the money to live on. Greets the children and hopes she and they are all well.</note>
