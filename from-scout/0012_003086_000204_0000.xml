            <p>Oct 7, 1918</p>
            <p>This diary is started Just one week later than I had planned to begin it for my devoted friend.
On account of Strict quarentine it has been impossible to go even to the canteen only across the
road from the barracks Saturday and Sunday morning I was the N.C.O. in charge of quarters and of
course could not leave quarters. Saturday the quaran-tine was lifted to the extent that we were able
to go to the Canteen and barber shop. Sunday</p>

            <p>afternoon was payday. Had hair cut in the afternoon - a thankful hour - at the same time
telephoned to Bp. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">M. kell</unclear> and Louis Estes home.
Learned that he is a 1st Lt. much to my joy. Sorry he is no longer at Sewanee. Made first visit to
Canteen to day and purchased this book- all they had, so it has to do. To-day, Monday is the easiest
day we have had. The mental work greater &amp; physical lighter from now on 1st Lt Campbell told us
to-day <del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">than</del> that we were to finish the course in 11
weeks. That is 8 weeks from now.</p>

            <p>Tuesday slipped away quickly My thoughts turned, after the days drill, to a very devoted friend
who died on Thursday Oct 2nd with pneumonia another victim to this terrible epidemic. She was
beautiful to look upon, accomplished, played the piano well and had a sweet voice was cultured and
refined. Mrs Alma <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Kbly Gethens</unclear> we lived next door to
each other all through our childhood and were like brother</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="0012_003086_000204_0008.jpg" xml:id="d3e178"/>
            <p>and sister. Most of all for my sister Rosa&apos;s sake I am sad. Dear Rosa has not so many
friends and Alma was her oldest I mean they were friends from childhood and the same age. She was I
reckon her closest too. They loved each other. Rosa an invilid (you remember Archdeacon we talked of
her a while at the Base camp) without many opportunities has not known very great happiness as I
would have her now. All my thoughts</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="0012_003086_000204_0009.jpg" xml:id="d3e184"/>
            <p>have been much with those Dear loved ones at home this week I shall be happy when I can help them
Some more financially But there are greater things than that I, through this time of trainig look
most of all to the time when they at home will receive the Blessed Sacrament with me They were with
me They were with me before I left home last Thurs and believe they will go again the benefit is
very great.</p>

            <p>We have taken up in our drill &quot;rushes&quot; as <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">skermirsh ers</unclear> both in squad and platoon formation. It&apos; great sport. Just like the
dive in football only we havn&apos;t pads on. Thus far the course has been very inclusive and
thorough. I should think a man ought to be prepared when he gets out to drill men. Training to go
right into the service of traing others to go right into the services of traing others to win this
war. It is a great inspiration. On Lieutenants Keep that before <del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">up</del> us we are going out to be leaders <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">nuce</unclear>,
some may be very good instructors but others darn poor leaders.</p>

            <p>Give some men a little authority and their heads swell right up their eyes roll around and they
are Generals at order. We have two in our platoon that have had a little experience and they even
presume to say the major is wrong and they are right The remarkable thing is how they make others
believe it is right. Then we have a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">wstn</unclear> big fellow

            <p>Another boy in our company died this morning and another boy went home because his brother is
dead. I went up to him just before we went out to drill this morning and told him I hoped he got his
pass all right (passes are hard to get even when there is a death in the family) and that his
brother would recover (he was not dead then)</p>

            <p>was very appreciatry. Well he did not get his pass until noon. In the mean time word came that
his brother was dead He was leaving just as we came in from drill. a boy in my squad by the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">mane of Shich</unclear> turned to me and said &quot;I wouldn&apos;t go
home if my brother or sister was dead or dying, <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">hu!</unclear>
what good would it do.&quot; I said &quot;Well, what about your mother and father and those that are
left.&quot; <del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">Could</del> Dont you reckon</p>

            <p>you could be of some comfort to them?&quot; He shrugged his sholder and threw out his hands and
with that New York sneer said &quot;To hell with them&quot;. This same boy wears a crucifix , a
little card, and piece of <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">ovel shape tin</unclear> this letter
for the Pope, he says, pinned to his jersey. It has not escaped my notice that he is one of the most
selfish boys in all the barracks room. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Jakes</unclear> all he

and nothing is vile enough for him about women</p>
            <p>The remarkable thing is how <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">just</unclear> this kind of a
person seems to attract men to him. All spare moments are occupied in vulgar actions and vile talk.
One is sneered at when one speaks of things aside from their line. Donald Hanks says these men make

some day.</p>
            <p>Saturday.</p>
            <p>We prepared for in-spection this morning but a special order cam through, and we had our weekly
examination from 7:30 to 9:30 instead of from 10:00 to 12:00. I was glad to get it over with</p>

            <p>It was not hard. Immediately after the exam. We were marched down to the ampitheatre <del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">by</del> in front of the Liberty Theatre. Then heard a lecture on
the retiring <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Septin</unclear> which is <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">wsed</unclear> through out the Army. A man is rated by his</p>

was a disappont-ment to us and that we could not go off on pass over the week end. After I did my
washing I <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">carried us</unclear> to the barrack room, and took a
little rest One of the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">hinsecat wer so I have had
has</unclear> gone by. We all learned this week where we stood. My scolarship is so much lower then
I want and I shall try to pull it up.</p>

            <p>My qualification <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">unuage</unclear> is 62 <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">cand</unclear> a fraction The highest is 69 I am eager to get up into
the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">first tin at hast</unclear>.</p>
            <p>About 20 of the boys were sent over into the 6 Batallion which starts out this week a new one
starts every month. About 10 others were dismissed altogether &quot;Benzined&quot; we call it. We
have great admiration for our Captain and Lieutenants. They are men of strong personalities force
and good <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">henenour</unclear>

            <p>Capt Brensen has been made Capt. Since we have been here. He is from Southern Ga. and talks just
like a negro. That takes with the fellows. What takes most is the way he takes the Lord&apos;s name
in vain I don&apos;t know why these officrs feel that that thing in particular is necessary or why
they think is necessary to use the vocabulary of the ordinary curs-ing and swearing man, but they do
it and the best of them are falling into it as time goes on.</p>

            <p>One very admirable and fine quality about them is that they are absolutely just and fair. They
have given these Candidates here 5 weeks in which to decide whether they want to be officers or
whether they think themselves fit to be officers, or whether they are able to qualify. In other
companies they &quot;benzined&quot; them after two weeks. Our Capt <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">lones in</unclear> and eats with us. He sings with us. He jokes with us. I have yet to
hear the first person make the slightest suggestion</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="0012_003086_000204_0022.jpg" xml:id="d3e368"/>
            <p>of taking advantage of him. He is firm and a man of his word absolutely. and will do anything in
the world he can for the fellows.</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant of our Platoon Lt. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Ekfort</unclear> is
&quot; hard boild&quot; Has strong opinions of his own and usually has his way. I should rather have
him than any one else. I some times think that he hasn&apos;t a great deal of confidence in me, but
not many people have. If I could command that I could do a hundred times as</p>

            <p>much. In the years of my life and experiences I have never been able to find out. Never been able
to solve the problem why people dislike me so why they seem to go away from <del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">f</del> me. or if they like me at all It is only for a little
while.</p>
