				       the Business there.</p>
            <p>The Mill is situate on Brandywine Creek abt.} 1 1/2 miles from Wilmington. &amp;is built but a few yards from the Margin of

            <p>The whole of the Building is covered with Cedar Shingles &amp;the general construction of the Mill is similar to most others
				       calculated to carry on Two Vats with the necessary boilers &amp;ca for sizing,washing &amp;Bleaching, the lower or ground    
				       floor is altogether paved with Brick &amp;every attention has been paid to the security of the fire places &amp;Stoves thro&apos;

				       the security of the Mill &amp;to save fuel.</p>
            <p>This Mill has now been conducted for abt.}  15 Years under a former Company, without the least accident, but the present
				       Conductor of the works Lawrence Greatrake who is an Englishman of a respectable Character is desiring to have the Mill &amp;
