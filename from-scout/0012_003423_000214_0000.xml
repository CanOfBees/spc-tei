            <p>It becomes my painful duty to inform you of the Death of your Brother who died on the night of the 27th of May from the effect of a painfull wound recieved while skirmishing with the Enemy Near <name type="place">Dallas, Ga.</name>  While I with you grieve for the Loss of a Brave soldier and companion it affords me extreme pleasure to know that He died as all Brave soldiers die in defence of His Country.  He was beloved by all of the company admired by the officers for his self sacrificing devotion to his country.  Enduring the hard marches and Fatigues of Soldier life with an endurance worthy of a "Veteran"  And when the Hour for Battle came was always found at His post ready to meet the "Foe"  Had it been my own Brother who was wounded I could not have felt more grieved all though acquainted only since</p>

            <p>He joined the Company by close association we had become warm friends and I loved Him for His <unclear reason="illegible" resp="PW">Manlines</unclear>for His Bravery.  I sympathise with you in the loss of an affectionate Brother tender my heartfelt sympathies to His Farther &amp; Mother.</p>
            <p>I have also to inform you that Thos. Ballard of your county was seriously wounded shortly after Henry died, but as far as I can learne He is doing well. John &amp; Harvey starns are Both well.</p>
            <p>The Main Battle has not yet been fought  I can give you no idea when it will come off we feel confident of Victory aided by the smiles of Heaven and trust that soon our Banners Will again wave in triumph over the Proud Hills of "Old Tennessee".</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>Hoping this may find you well I beg leave to remain with much respect  your Friend</salute>
