            <p>The Sloop Nancy  G. H. Norris Master Insured on the 6th Instant at your Office, returned to this port on the day before yesterday /Sunday/ after being Several days at Sea__ under protest of the Mate of Seamen privately agreed upon without the Consent or knowledge of Capt. Norris.</p>
            <p>It appears by the several affidavits of the people that they were seduced by the mates persuasions to protest against the Captain proceeding on the Voyage pretending that the breast hook was started &amp;one of the Rudder Irons loose_ a Survey has been Called and neither of these things appear true &amp;the Vessel is declared tight Staunch &amp;Strong and in all things fit for sea.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to say what the intentions of the mate were, but from a number of circumstances combined, it appears he intended to run away with the Vessel &amp;the Better to do this &amp;induce the people to join him in a protest against the</p>

            <p>the Captain proceeding, he privately bored a hole with a three quarter Auger thro the bottom of the Vessel and she made considerable water through it so that it was but with constant labour with our pump they could keep her free.</p>
            <p>It therefore remains with the assurers to say whether the Cargo shall be discharged here or not to examine if there are any damaged goods on board &amp;if yes to say what shall be done with them __</p>
            <p>For our parts believing as we do that very little water has been in her at any our time &amp;knowing that the goods on the Ground <unclear reason="illegible" resp="pw">Lecn</unclear>are nails Only __ we believe the damage if any must be very trifling and not worth while discharging the Vessel for ___</p>
            <p>The Vessel has not been distressed _ did not leak except while the whole bored by the mate remained Open neither was any thing carried away or lost and the Cause of returning appears to be a nefarious Scheme of the Mates _ who run off as soon as he could steal himself on shore  &amp;
  has not been since found not withstanding there has been three Civil Officers After him these two days.</p>
            <p>Captn Norris in consequence of three days</p>

            <p>days &amp;nights watching On Deck / being from the Conduct of the mate too much afraid of his life to go below / has contracted a Very severe Cold this Physician considers him too Ill to  proceed directly on the voyage _ we may therefor find it necessary to put the Nancy under the Command of another Captain.</p>
            <p>Your Most Obed Servts.</p>
