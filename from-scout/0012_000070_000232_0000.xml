               <note type="abstract">In this letter, dated June 16, 1861 E.A. Glass in Chattanooga, Tenn. writes to O.P. Temple in Knoxville, Tenn., to request that Temple write to Constable William Rogers to &quot;indulge&quot; him on an outstanding debt. Rogers has seized some of Glass&apos; property in repayment of the debt. Glass suggests that if Temple does not help him, he will take advantage of recent legislation that states &quot;debts due to Northern men cannot be forced.&quot;</note>
