            <p>Poland, Ohio, Feb 4th/65</p>
            <p>Col O P Temple:</p>
            <p>Dr Sr;</p>
            <p>Yours of Jan 19th came to hand a few days since.</p>
            <p>I am pleased to know that you and your family are well and living in a good degree of security. </p>
            <p>A late number of Brownlow&apos;s Whig came a few days since (the only copy recd for some months) containing many items of much interest to us, and not the least, that C Ramsey, Fox and Sperry are in federal hands in Knoxville. I hope that strict justice, executed in mercy, will be dealt to each of them.</p>

            <p>I wish I was with you, laboring successfully in my profession, to aid in establishing a new and higher order of interest in educational matters than existed there before the rebellion.</p>
            <p>But to business.</p>
            <p>I leave my claim against Dr Doak in your hands to be executed as soon as you may be able. I cannot now lay my hands on the note or I would enclose it in this. </p>
            <p>As to my claims on the estate of John Sloan (deceased) Col Craig can give you all the information necessary.
</p>
            <p>Mr Craig had my papers and recd the money at the hands of Mr Sloan and paid it over to the Confed-</p>

            <p>erate authorities. I wish you would give early attention to this matter, for, in view of the manner was treated by Mr Sloan, I am determined to get what is due me if I can</p>
            <p>My cirtificate of deposite in the old bank of S Morrow (deceased) is in the hands of Perez Dickinson Esq. I find by reference to a letter of Robert Morrow, that my deposite was payable in S Carolina and Georgia money of the best quality. I suppose I am entitiled to Savannah or any other money of the states that I may select. I shall write soon to Mr Dickinson</p>

            <p>or col Baxter in regard to it. What has become of Mr Morrow&apos;s family since his decease. I supposed Col Baxter was a partner of Mr Morrow&apos;s. Will the business of the bank be settled by Col Baxter?</p>
            <p>I notice upon turning this leaf that I have written upon a port of two sheets. </p>
            <p>Hoping to hear from you in due tiem. I am</p>
            <p>Yours Truly</p>
