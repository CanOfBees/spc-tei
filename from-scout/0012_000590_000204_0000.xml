            <p>general remarks</p>
            <p>If payment to the Cherokees on the powers of attorney filed be objected to on
                  account of their being Cherokees.</p>
            <p>To reply then to that under the stipulations of the treaty they are to be regarded
                  as citizens--and the same rules must apply to them as to any other citizens of the
                  United States. The law passed in relation to them in NC authorises them to
                  transact their business by power of attorney</p>
            <p>But it is said that the Cherokees remaining east are not entitled to removal and
                  subsistence to place them on terms of equality with those who chose to emigrate,
                  because they had to expend that amount on their journey. If they did it was a good
                  investment. They thereby attained lands without having them to purchase and a
                  share of the permanent funds of the nation to the amount of 764,000.00. But if the
                  reason for not paying the Cherokees east removal and subsistence allowance because
                  those who emigrated had to expend that amount on their journey the same reason
                  will hold good in not paying them for their improvements. For those who emigrated
                  were expected to expend the money due them for improvements in making others at
                  their new homes</p>
            <p>The 8th article provides that such as are capable of removing themselves shall be
                  permitted to do so, and allowed in full for claims for removal and subsistence
                  53.33 which sum was to be paid before they started out of which they could defray
                  the expenses of removal &amp; subsistence and three fourths of all the Cherokees
                  who removed under the treaty were paid that sum before they started an objection
                  to that was that some might after they had been paid not remove to the county
                  assigned them it would seem that objection could not exist now. Those remaining
                  having become citiziens provided the means promised by the government were paid to
                  them the promise would be complied with and if they then did not remove to the
                  county assigned them which they had contributed to purchase the fault would be
                  theirs and attributable to the government. If the reason for not paying before the
                  started be a good one that they then might not go the same reason would hold good
                  for not paying them after their arrival for they might then not stay in the
                  county. If the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">giving</unclear> them the
                  land in <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">cemmin</unclear> a permanent

                  privileges of their own laws will not induce them to go and remain there it will
                  be useless to withold from them their dues to accomplish that object the strongest
                  argument will be furnished against theirs and joining their people they will say
                  it the government will not comply with her promise to us</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="0012_000590_000204_0008.jpg" xml:id="d3e245"/>
            <p>what reason have we to believe that she will do so, if as we are to remove first
                  if she now disregards her promises as respects the personal benefits provided for
                  in the treaty will she guartee the promised land us if she will talk to us with a
                  forked tongue in one part of the treaty she will eventually do so in all. And
                  after we had left the land of Our fathers and a state which has been and is now
                  kind to us, and may soon have to leave <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">that</unclear> country</p>
            <p>How is it ascertained that the word claims was intended to cover spoliations only

            <p>Dear sir your favor of the 9th March enclosing three of your claims and a power of
               attorney was received on my arrival here I will endeavor to attend to the requests
               contained therein Mr. Crawford Commissioner of Indian Affairs is now absent and will
               not return before the middle of next month. No <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">cla</unclear> arrising under the Cherokee treaty of 1835 &amp; 6 have been taken
               up nor will they be acted on until his return. I had an interview with Mr. Poinsett
               today and he informs me nothing can be done respecting the claims until Mr. Crawford
               returns and reports to him. I am inclined to think the whole business will be
               received before any claims are paid and will result in favor of the claimants I write
               you now to inform you of the delay that will take place in the settlement of those
               claims and will write you again when I obtain information I think you would be
               pleased to receive. Mr Churchwell is here but speaks of returning home in a few days,

            <p>I received your letter of the 9th of March inclosing some depositions with
               instructions in relation to the management of your business all of which matters and
               things I will endeavor to attend to. The Cherokee business will be delayed by the
               absence of Mr. Crawford Com of I A who is now absent and will not return before the
               middle of next month Mr. Churchwell went to see the Hon J R Poinsett today to
               asertain if the busineses could not be taken up in the absence of Mr Crawford but he
               informs us it cannot as a report has to be made to him by the Commissioner of Indian
               Affairs before he can act on the claims but he <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">seems</unclear> disposed to have it acted on asoon as possible I am now inclined
               to think all the business acted on by the Board of Commissioners will be examined
               before any payments are made the result of which will probably be in favor of the
               claimants Mr. Churchwell speaks of returning home in a few days I will keep you
               informed of the progress of our claims. I am in good health</p>

            <p>some little money to spend and a tollerable stock of patience which has now been
               exhausted and I am in hopes will not be when attending to the business here I have

               please inform your old friend Betsy Woodward of the situation of business here and
               say to her it is uncertain at what time I can return I received a line from squire
               Bridges requesting me to pay to his brother in Baltimore $500 of the money collected
               for you please inform him the delay that will probably take place before the money

            <p>22d April 1839</p>
            <p>Dear sir,</p>
            <p>This day I had an interview with the Hon J R Poinsett Secretary of War. I informed
               him that the Cherokees who had been lying out in the mountains had come in settled
               down on states land and wished to be permited to remain until they should make it
               their choice to go west and in the event of their desiding to remove west at a
               subsequent period they wished to be provided with removal and subsistence allowance.
               He replied the Department was disposed to leave them to the freedom of their own
               choice and under the control of the state in which they resided and as to the removal
               and subsistence allowance it would be furnished provided they wished to remove</p>
            <p>The business acted on by the Board of Commissioners Mr. Poinsett informs me cannot be
               taken up before the middle of next month in consequence of the absence of Mr.
               Crawford Commissioner of Indian Affairs who has to review the business and report to
               the secretary of war thereupon before the Department can act on it. The only
               objection I have to this course is the delay it will occasion I am inclined</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="0012_000590_000204_0011.jpg" xml:id="d3e317"/>
            <p>to think the claimants will not be injured by it in any other respect. I am in good
               health and I am in hopes I have a sufficient stock of patience to last me until this
               business is disposed of Mr. Churchwell is here but designs leaving for home in a few
               days and will leave his business for me to attend to. Johnson Rogers is also here and
               since his arrival has married a girl by the name of <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Mount</unclear> who resided in this city Johnson speaks of going West in
               a few days. I will write you occasionally and let you know how the business is
               progressing please inform Mrs Welch and such of my Cherokee friends as you may see
               the particulars of this letter say to them the Department is willing for the few
               Cherokees remaining East to continue there but only on condition they conduct
               themselves well bad conduct dissipation &amp;c might change the intention of the
               Departmentvery respectfully</p>

               Bank of Louisiana in favour of Carruthers. I was informed by the Cashier that the

               moving into another building <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">emled</unclear>
               for the rise of the Bank and it was out of his power to accommodate me he at the same

               and would have the subject investigated when called on Mr <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Spofford merchant</unclear> who accompanied me to the cashier promised

               called to see Matthew Fuller ascertained the amount you were due them and at the same

               remit the amount due from you. In consequence of the absence of Mr Crawford
               Commissioner of Indian Affairs the business arising under the Cherokee treaty was not
               until lately taken up for investigation. I availed myself of the earliest opportunity
               to bring a question before the Department to ascertain whether or not the division of
               the board of commissioners on claims arising under the Cherokee treaty would be final
               if so it would be unnecessary to prepare the rejected claims for investigation to day
               I called to see Mr Crawford respecting it and am informed by him that an answer will

               Carolina but in case they should subsequently desire to emigrate removal and
               subsistence allowance will be furnished them. what length of time will be given them
               for that purpose I have not yet ascertained I design trying to ascertain the

               by the government before I leave. it being an item of some importance to the

            <p>Extract</p>
            <p>Dear sir. I have been informed of the absence of your brother causes unknown to me
               may justify his cause. A few days since read a letter from Jas. H Bryson who informs
               me he is not the only one who loaned my money to Mr Cuningham. have written to him to
               continue in business at that place until I my return. I will then inquire into the
               conduct disapproved by me. I hope to find by strict attention to business in my
               absence I shall be induced to change my former intentions especially if he has not
               been guilty to the amount I had supposed and that deficiency should be chargable to
               one in my employment of whom I had hoped better things my experience has long since
               taught me to believe all persons are liable to err. therefore small ones may be
               overlooked when integrity is not involved. Therewith send you the Bills of goods and
               bills of lading the cost will be marked in letters and the usual percent laid except
               on the article of prints on that article 75 percent will be laid, if any goods you
               cannot ascertain the cost of lay them away in Boxes until I return. Be careful not to
               make bad debts though when you refuse credit dont give offense by improper language
               make no accounts with Indians until I return. Count all the money you can and forward
               to to Augusta to settle debts against the Indian town store should any remain if not
               have it paid over to Clark McLuis and co on my individual <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">aud</unclear>. If you have no use for the teams on their arrival send
               them back to Augusta for the balance of the goods if any balance in groceries such as
               will be needed but send cash to pay for them. you will remain at the Indian town
               store until my return unless otherwise instructed and manage the same agreeable to
               the rules adopted for the government thereof. If not done have completed the
               Oconalufta Turnpike road and have it received and forward a certificate there of to
               me at Raleigh to the care of Maj Henlow have read the accompanying communcation to
               the Indians, extract on the other side also forward letter to mothers, in which
               inform her I am in good health dont know when I can return</p>

            <p>To Nicholas Woodfin</p>
            <p>Dear Sir. My horse saddle &amp;c I send you by the bearer Mr Starritt if you need him
               keep him and use him as your own until my return if you dont wish to use him let Mr
               Smith take care of him for me. I will probably return before the last of this month.
               I am engaged at present in making out the claims of Cherokees remaining east so as to
               exhibit to the Department the total amount due them that it may be deducted from the
               amount sent west. The business of the Cherokee Commissioners is now undergoing an
               examination which makes it important that I should remain until the business of the
               Cherokees remaining east is disposed of. One object I have in view is to procure the
               removal and subsistence allowance amounting to $53.3343 each to be placed on interest
               for them to be applied to the removing such Cherokees as of now remain when they
               shall desire to join their people west and the probability is that in a few years
               they will desire to do so. Mr. Crawford Commissioner of Indian Affairs seems to be
               coming to the conclusion that the decision made by the Board of Commissioners on
               Cherokee claims will be regarded as final if so the money due you and Mr Condler will
               be paid. I presume without further trouble yours</p>

            <p>Dear sir</p>
            <p>The business of Cherokee claimants has been much longer delayed than I had expected
               which in part has been occasioned by the absence of Mr Crawford Commissioner of
               Indian Affairs. I availed myself of the earliest opportunity after his return to the
               city to communicate to him my business and through him asked of the Department to be
               informed if the decisions made on claims by the Board of Cherokee Commissioners
               acting under the treaty of 1835 would be considered as final or would they be
               reexamined and subject to the final action of the Department to this communication I
               have as yet received no answer the importance of the decision taking into
               consideration the large amount involved I am informed has occasioned the delay but Mr
               Crawford assures me I shall obtain an answer shortly If the decisions made by the
               Board of Commissioners be considered final then I have only to apply for payment of
               the judgments given by them. And it will be unnecessary at this time to prepare the
               rejected claims. For the above reason I have not yet obtained the money due you and
               Mr Candler nor indeed can I until the decision is made above refered to</p>
            <p>As I shall probably have to remain here some time you will please write to me on the
               receipt of this letter and inform me what was done at the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Yancy</unclear> Court respecting the Ramsey town tract of land if a
                  <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">duree</unclear> of sale was obtained if so
               at what time it will be sold and in case I cannot come on in time to attend the stale
               I have to request you and Mr guinn to attend to it for me my object to be attained
               thereby as well as the management thereof being known to you and that gentleman I
               deem instructions from me unnecessary. I have therefore only to add extinguish the
               claims of the mortgages for as small a sum as you can as the small tract of land
               included in the mortgage not <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">cuoved</unclear>
               by my claim is not very valuable</p>

            <p>Dear sir. I wrote you from Baltimore on my return from New York to which letter not
               having received an answer I am inclined to believe the the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">keeper</unclear> of the Utica House with whom it was
               left had neglected to forward it to the post office. As it think it probable none of
               the money due me here will be paid before next fall the small amount 1200$ I let you
               have at this place as I went on to New York will be needed and if you could remit it
               to me at this place in a few days it would be very acceptable. I have at length got
               Mr Crawford to commence an examination of the business transacted by the Cherokee
               Commissioners but I am of opinion in a few days will satisfy him that the President
               will have to appoint a commissioner to examine that business this is only an opinion
               of mine but should it turn out as I have anticipated will you please inform me if it
               would suit you to accept the appointment. I think I shall be able to procure for the
               Oconalufta Indians at some future period their allowance for removal and subsistence
               in as much as they were included in the census of the Cherokee nation and resided in
               in the hunting ground not relinquished and to which they had the right by treaty
               stipulation at the time the treaty of 1835 was concluded If you should have business
               here I would be pleased to see you before I leave yours &amp;c Wm H Thomas</p>

            <p>Peach tree po office. The absence of Mr Crawford Commissioner of Indian Affairs has
               occasioned considerable delay in your business. After his return to this place I
               availed myself of the earliest opportunity to call his attention and that of the
               Department to the subject of your claims arising the Treaty of 1835 &amp; 6 and asked
               to be informed whether or not the decisions made by the Board of Commissioners on
               claims arising undersaid treaty would be regarded as final or would their proceedings
               be regarded as subject to examination and ajudication by the Department of Indian
               Affairs. the commissioner of Indian Affairs informed me I should have an answer so
               soon as it could be given but the importance of the decision taking into
               consideration the large amount involved therein would necessarily require some time
               to prepare it. my object in ascertaining the above was to ascertain if it would be
               necessary to prepare the rejected claims for examination. I subsequently filed a
               letter</p>
            <pb n="028" facs="0012_000590_000204_0028.jpg" xml:id="d3e1048"/>
            <p>before the Commission of Indian Affairs asking the claims due the Cherokees I
               represented for improvements and property sold to be taken up and settled as they
               would not be interfered with by the above decision I have not as yet received an
               answer to either of the above communications. I had reason to expect one before this
               time and delayed writing to on that account hoping to have had the pleasure of
               enclosing you the answers to the questions submited. I think it probable I shall
               receive them next week and in case I do will enclose you a copy thereof for your
               information. As we had anticipated the chiefs from Arkansaw have protested against
               the payment of claims East and have requested all the money due the Cherokee people
               under the Cherokee treaty of 1835 be sent west there to be paid off to the different
               claimants but this with some other difficulties I am in hopes can be overcome. and if
               nothing more can be done for you I think it probable the money can be detained and
               not west which will give an opportunity for making further arrangements</p>
            <p>On my first arrival in the city I informed the Hon Secretary of War Joel R. Poinsett
               of the desires of the Cherokees remaining East first that they wished to be permited
               to remain where they were undisturbed by the government of the United States and
               wantted an assurance that they should be permited to do so. Secondly if any should
               here after wish to emigrate they wanted removal and subsistence allowance furnished
               and thirdly all other claims wanted paid to them where they were. he informed me
               their request to remain would be complied with and they would be left to the call of
               the state in which they reside and should any wish to join their friends in the west
               next fall removal and subsistence allowance would be furnished but as to the third
               request he could make no decision on that until a report was made to him by Mr
               Crawford Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Advize your people to be industrious,
               honest, and temperate, and to live in peace with each other and their white neighbors
               very respectfully yours &amp;c</p>

               Affairs how long I will be required to remain is uncertain I am inclined to think I
               will be able to reach home by the 15 of next month. collect what money you can and
               discharge the debts against the stores in the nation investigation will be of
               advantage to the claimants should the claim be investigated probable the government
               will pay none until all is examined in relation to ginsang to keep a correct account

            <p>Dear sir. the absence of Mr Crawford Commissioner of Indian Affairs has occasioned
               considerable delay in our business I availed myself of the earliest opportunity after
               his return to submit a question to the Department to ascertain if the decision made
               by the Board of Commissioners would be regarded as final, having anticipated an
               answer for some time past I delayed writing to you in to have have had the pleasure
               of furnishing you with a copy thereof but today in conversation with Mr Crawford he
               informed me he was inclined to think no final decision could be made until the
               proceedings of the Commissioners were examined and a report made thereon to
               accomplish that he seems to think will require near three months and the final
               decision of the Department will no doubt much depend upon the apparent justice or
               injustice done the claimants a due regard being had to the commissioners having acted
               in strict accordance with the treaty. Johnston Rogers is still here and insists on
               the decision made by the Board of Commissioners being final agreeable to the treaty
               and <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">such</unclear> was the understading of the
               parties to that instrument I think we have nothing to fear from an investigation the
               claims that have</p>

            <p>been approved of would no doubt be passed &amp; many of the rejected claims would
               would be allowed by the Department as they would be apt to give a more liberal
                  <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">constrution</unclear> to the treaty than was
               given to it by the commissioners The individual business I have to attend to for

            <p>gentlemen I have been detained here since the first of last month trying to procure a
               settlement of a claim due me as contractor for the troops stationed in the Cherokee
               nation the delay has in part been owing to the report of the Quartermaster not being
               as full &amp; explanatory as it might have been, which caused me to have to send home
               for papers and evidence to establish the claims. I am inclined to think payment will
               be made me in the first of next month. I have also a considerable number of Cherokee
               claims arising under the Cherokee treaty of 1835 to settle before I leave here the
               amount due my friends in Charleston will be remitted as soon as received having a

               written home instructing remittances to be made from there also If you have any debts
               against Nathan B. Hyatt (deceased) formerly of the firm of Lord and Hyatt if you will
               authenticate them and forward them to me at this place I will try to collect them he
               had money due from the United States for improvements. it is probable the government

            <p>Dear sir. I have been here since the first of last month attending to the business of
               Cherokees remaining east The absence of Mr Crawford Commissioner of Indian Affairs
               has occasioned a delay in the investigation of claims arising under the late Cherokee
               treaty but since his return the business has been taken up and is undergoing an
               investigation which will probably be completed towards the last the last of next
               september before that is done I am inclined to think it will not be ascertained
               whether the Department regards the decisions made by the Board of Commissioners as
               final or subject to a new investigation where apparent injustice has been done the
               claimaints a due regard being had to the commissioners having acted within the scope
               of their authority as desired from the treaty. I expect to remain here until some
               time in next month. should I ascertain any thing of importance to you I will inform
               you of it</p>
            <p>The entries made by me in Sevier County I understand were sold to satisfy the demand
               for the taxes will you please enquire into it for me and if the time has not expired
               purchase of the individual who became the purchaser of those lands take his title
               thereto in my individual name and pay him the amount allowed by law on redeeming land
               sold for the taxes if he will not relinquish his rights on those conditions please
               pay for me the amount required by law for their redemption (if you have any doubts as
               to that title reenter the lands in my name) and enclose a statement thereof to me at
               Scotts Creek po. Haywood NC. I want you to try and encourage your people to complete
               their part of the Smoky Mountain road, agreeable to my instructions my part is
               completed before this time and I am extremely anxious that the Tennessee part should
               be completed before fall. On my return home I will try to have undertaken the road
               from Scotts Creek to Perkins H by the way of <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Toxway</unclear> which would add considerable to the travelling on the Oconalufta

            <p>June 24th 1839</p>
            <p>Dear sir. Mr Crawford has not as yet answered my communication on the subject of the
               17th article of the treaty. A few days since in conversation with him, he informed me
               he was inclined to think no final decision could be made until the proceedings of the
               Board of Commissioners was investigated which could not be done before the last of
               next September. At present he was of opinion he would decide that the decisions of
               the commissioners on claims provided for by the treaty would be final, where they had
               acted in accordance therewith but sais he has not examined enough of the business to
               give an opinion <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">he bound</unclear> by the right
               of construing the treaty as to the claims provided for he seems to think belongs to
               the Department it appears to me that he must then come to the conclusion that their
               decisions are not final, for it the Department have the right to construe the treaty
               and the commissioners are bound thereby a different construction may be given to the
               treaty from the one given by the commissioners and consequently a change must take
               place in their decisions. I have informed Mr Crawford that I am willing an
               investigation of the business transacted by the commissioners shall take place, and
               that I have no doubt the claimaints would be benefited thereby, as the Department
               would be certain to place a more liberal construction on the treaty than was given to
               it by the commissioners. Mr Rogers most of the sime since you were here has been
               insisting that the decisions of the commissioners should be regarded as final and
               that such was the understanding of the parties to the treaty but I have at length of
               got him to believe it would be his interest to have the rejected claims
               investigated</p>
            <pb n="036" facs="0012_000590_000204_0036.jpg" xml:id="d3e1265"/>
            <p>and he seems contented to stay at home with his Washington wife without troubling the
               Department much about decisions. I expect to be detained here until some time in next
               month making out the claims of Cherokees remaining east which if allowed must be
               deducted from the amount sent west. during my stay here should I receive any
               information in relation to our claims which I think would be interesting to you I
               will inform you of it. Mr. Meex Clk of Reservation Department requested me to say to
               you he had delayed an answer to your letter waiting to ascertain the commissioners
               opinion by his answer to me it is probable I shall pass through Knoxville shortly
               after my return when I can inform you more fully in relation to the business here</p>

            <p>Dear sir. your favor of the 20th just received this morning. my business not yet

               that the goods have not arrived. part were shipped by the way of savanna. those
               purchased in New York for Indian Town were shipped to Charleston with instructions to
               forward to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">geo Panott</unclear>. I shipped by
               savanna to save freight not anticipating any delay in their passage up the river. the
               purchase of groceries and smith goods under the circumstances advisable. having been
               previously agreed on it will be necessary to keep a calculation of expenses to
               ascertain whether it is profitable or unprofitable. I have enjoyed good health since
               I wrote you before</p>
            <p>you will make and file a calculation of the value of the concern and of the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">dilets</unclear> due there from and on the arrival of
               the new goods commence selling them under previous rules and instructions, and on my
               return we will make such additional arrangements as I think justice may require a due
               regard being had to your interest as well as mine, and from your apparent disposition
               heretofore to yield to what is right I presume an arrangement can be made to the
               satisfaction of both. give my respects to your family as also to that of D Bryson and
               other <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">enjuring</unclear> friends. enquire of Mr

            <p>Indian Town. sir your letter of the 17th <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Instans</unclear> was received on the 24th and its contents have been noticed you
               seem to think the statement in my last communication relative to the money bound Mr
               Cuningham an impeachment of your integrity which was not intended nor does the letter
               warrant any such construction nor did I in any way impeach the integrity of Mr Bryson
               the light to which I received it from the first was that it was an act of imprudence
               in transcending the authority of a clerk to loan money without the consent of the of
               the principal or his knowledge not warrantable under any circumstances. yet there had
               been no rule adopted consequently none violated. I considered it excusable but had
               integrity been involved once destroyed never can be restored. I would be sorry to
               think I would form such opinion respecting any person in my employment. your
               statement respecting the money I have no doubt is correct I have received a similar
               statement of Mr Bryson and after reflecting upon the frank acknowledgement you had
               both made concluded if on my return I found no other occasion of dissatisfaction to
               pass it by unnoticed. I am aware that to err is what are liable to but heretofore
               having believed you regarded my interest as identified with your own was unwilling to
               believe you guilty of any act which duty to you as well as myself compelled me to
               disapprove In future I hope to have no occasion to express my disapprobation which is
               by no means pleasant to me nor agreeable to my desire. when I employ young men I dont
               only look to the expiration of their terms of service but to the station they are
               preparing to fill afterwards and I have ever been pleased to advance</p>

               at present uncertain it is probable the part in which I am interested as agent will
               be disposed of in next month until that is done I can not leave here but will leave
               immediately afterwards. the importance of my business here taking into consideration
               the large amount involved make it important that I should remain until the imprtant

            <p>Sir. your letter of the 28th was received this morning in relation to the proposition
               contained therein of conveying to me your interest in the lands purchased under a
               contract made in 1836, I am writing to allow you the lawful interest on your money to
               be deducted from the sum I loaned you if this proposition be approved of the original
               contract respecting the land with the small balance of the two hundred dollars you
               will please enclose to me by mail at this place. Mr Crawford Com I A seems to be
               coming to your conclusion respecting the decisions of the Board of Commissioners made
               under the Cherokee treaty of 1835. the only difficulty with him at present seems to
               be the right of construing the treaty whether the commissioners had the right to
               construe the treaty and adjudicate claim claims arrising under it accordingly or had
               the department of I A the right to construe the treaty would like to have your
               opinion in relation thereto. I hope the country you design moving to may suit you and
               tend to your advantage I think I shall visit that and the Arkansaw county next fall

            <p>Dear Sirs.</p>
            <p>I have been here since the first of last month trying to procure payment on claims
               due me from the United States a part as contractor of the Army formerly stationed in
               the Cherokee nation on which payment had been delayed in consequence of the AA
               Quartermaster having failed to annex to his return the proper certificate I presume
               the objection will be removed and payment made sometime in next month on the recept
               of which the money due you from me individually will be remited the balance due for
               goods purchased for the other stores I have written home instructing it to be
               remitted as soon as possible I expect to need new cloth on my return yours &amp;c</p>

            <p>June 30th 1839</p>
            <p>Dear sir. your communication requesting a remittance of four hundred dollars was duly
               received. in consequence of some want of formality your claim had again to be
               referred to Col Buck who has charge of the emigrating <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Business</unclear> and has been reported by him to the commissioner of
               Indian Affairs who for want of time to act on it has not yet made his report to the
               Affairs secretary of War you can form no idea of the business now before the Indian
               Department in addition to the Cherokee business there and the claims arrising under
               the treaties made with the Creeks and many other tribes the business transacted by
               the Commissioner under</p>
            <pb n="043" facs="0012_000590_000204_0043.jpg" xml:id="d3e1489"/>
            <p>the Cherokee treaty is now undergoing an investigation. I presume no payment will be
               made on any Cherokee claims until all is examined and reported to the Secretary of
               War and receives his approval. I have brought the claims of the Cherokees East before
               the Department and supported them by the best evidence I could procure as yet have
               received no decision thereon the probability is that I will not before the last of
               next month. I shall remain as long as I think the interest of the claimants
               necessarily requires I am at present engaged in making a report to the commissioners
               of Indian Affairs showing the amount due the Cherokees East under the provisions of
               the late treaty. The small book of valuations made by you and squire Hare was
               misplaced when I came here and was only found a few days since. I have not yet
               ascertained from the commissioner what his opinion is respecting those valuations. on
               examination I find gen Smith was not in office when those valuations were made and at
               the time he gave you and Squire Hare the order though that defect may escape the
               notice of the commissioners and if noticed may probably be explained away. I regret
               that your claim has not been paid which would have enabled me to comply with your
               request. I delayed writing to you in hopes of being able to remit you the money
               required. give my respects to Mrs Love</p>

            <p>Dear sir. Mr Crawford Com I A is progressing with the examination of the claims
               arising under the Cherokee treaty he seems <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">inclined</unclear> to come to the conclusion that the decisions on claims
               provided for by the treaty are final where they have acted in accordance with their
               authority derived therefrom but at the same time appears to think the Department had
               the right to construe the treaty and to decide what claims are provided for should he
               finally come to this latter conclusion a change of the</p>
            <pb n="044" facs="0012_000590_000204_0044.jpg" xml:id="d3e1514"/>
            <p>decisions of the commissioners must follow as a consequence. I am engaged at present
               in making out a report to the commissioner I A of the amounts due the Cherokees
               remaining East under the provisions of the treaty I will probably remain until the
               last of this month. I am much pleased with Mr Crawford as he is a very pleasant man
               to transact business with and I believe disposed to do right he seems to have none of
               judge Kennedys arstocratic notions of I will and you shall could we have had him to
               act on Cherokee claims at first I have no doubt a more liberal construction would
               have been given to the treaty and no sale of a reservation would have been regarded
               as a sale except such as would have been adjudged legal by the courts of the state in
               which the reservation was situated. This was one objection I made to the decisions of
               the commissioners that they in this particular had misconstrued the treaty and
               regarded the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">reserves</unclear> as having sold
               their reservations when they had <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">recd</unclear>
               little or no compensation, and that they should have regarded no sales except such as
               above stated which as far as I have ascertained are the views of the Department in an
               equitable point of view. J K Rogers is still here and until lately has been insisting
               on the commissioner that the decisions made by the Board of Commissioners should be
               regarded as final, but he has lately come to the conclusion that it is his interest
               to have the rejected claims investigated, and now argues that the decisions ought not
               to be final only on claims <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">allowed</unclear>
               but he is so pleased with the company of his wife he has but little time to attend to
               any other claims if I have friends who think proper to inquire about me give my

            <p>July 4 1839</p>
            <p>Dear sir. I called the attention of Mr Crawford to your claim and Mr Loves
               immediately after his return to the city but owing to the great quantity of business
               arrising under the Creek and other treaties he has not yet acted on it but I presume
               he will in the course of this month. he is progressing with the investigation of the
               business transacted by the board of commissioners under the Cherokee treaty of 1835
               respecting which he seems not to have come to any conclusion as to their decisions on
               claims being final. Though yesterday in conversation he informed me he thought it
               probable he would decide their decisions on claims provided for by the treaty in the
               opinions of this Department would be final but if claims had been allowed which in
               the opinion of the Department had not been provided for in that case the decision
               would be reversed and as to the rejected claims he was inclined to think now could be
               allowed by the Department but it is obvious Mr Crawford must in some respects change
               his opinion as to the decisions of the commissioners for if he decides that a part of
               the decisions on claims allowed are not final it follows that their decisions cannot
               be regarded as final on any and a reinvestigation must take place of all the claims
               which would no doubt be the advantage of the claimants I am engaged in making out a
               report to the Department of all the money due the Cherokees remaining under the
               provisions of the treaty with a view if I can do nothing more that it may be retained
               and not sent west. I expect to have to remain here until the first of next month. I
               will endeavor in the meantime to promote the interest of those who have intrusted me
               with their business as much as in my power. your claim will be disposed of in some
               way before I leave and I am in hopes will be in a manner satisfactory to you This is
               an idle day here as relates to business transactions this and chirstmas are days on

            <p>The Agents appointed to collect and sell Indian property made a report thereof to the

               the claims of Cherokees whose property has been sold this money was by them turned
               over to Mr Crittenden US disbg agt and the amount turned over to him they reported to
               the office of I A a sum corresponding with their report has been paid over by said
               disbg Agt to Daniel Kurts disbg Agt for the use of the claimants to suppose that the
               above sum is not sufficient to satisfy all the claims is to presume that the return
               of the commissioners is incorrect as there can be no dificiency if their report be

               will probably complete the decisions in which the above Cherokees are interested
               betwixt the 10th and 15th of next month I am satisfied that the commissioner of
               Indian Affairs is doing all he can to have the business disposed of the large amount
               involved of the above decisions will compel me to remain notwithstanding my desire to
               return but when a business is commenced it must be persevered in until completed I
               write in the war office from 9 in the morning until 5 in the evening until 5 in the
               evening and then at my room until from 10 to 11 oclock but the labourious part of my
               business is nearly completed after a few days I will be less confined. As to my
               business entrusted to your care no new instructions are deemed necessary previous
               instructions will be observed until changed</p>
            <p>By information received here the Cherokees in Arkansaw are in a great state of
               excitement some reports say Maj Ridge Jno Ridge <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Boudenote</unclear> and John Ross are killed and other statements say Ridge are
               killed only I presume the War Department will be correctly informed in a few days
               Inform mother I am in good health and believe this climate agrees with me as well as
               any I have ever been in I will continue to write until I return give my respects to
               inquiring friends I have been expecting a letter from you several days and suppose
               one is on the way in answer to my letter requesting information as to white having
               been taken from the civil by the military authority yours &amp;c</p>

            <p>Sir I would respectfully call your attention to the claim of Mr. Cuningham and the
               evidence in support of it and by leave to ask a reconsideration thereof and to state
               the ground upon which it is asked marked A voucher exhibiting the services performed
               and perdiem allowance amounting in the aggregate to $437.50 which claims is supported
               by the deposition of claimant and the accompanying affidavits of A Battle, and Jas
               Cuningham marked B. two of the teamsters which is further corrobarted by the
               deposition of Maj D R Lowry A A Q U at Fort Lindsay NC marked C. Capt Collins admited
               to him that the claimant had performed the services for the Ustates all the evidence
               proves that the services were performed in the removal of the Indians. It is thought
               probable that this claim should have been referred to the second Auditor intead of
               the third as it is for services connected with the removal of Indians</p>
            <p>2 The statement of Capt Collins as to the contract reported to have been made with
               claimant is believed that it should be inadmissible unless evidenced by the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">crete out</unclear> refered to claimant thinks it
               unjust to withold from him the money due from the Ustates for services the
               performance of which is admited without even the Bond being produced on which the
               forfeitfure is claimed he alledges he proposed compliance with the request of Capt
               Collins provided he was permited to accompany his teams as agreed on when he entered
               the service</p>
            <pb n="060" facs="0012_000590_000204_0060.jpg" xml:id="d3e2057"/>
            <p>but being a poor man and having to rely on the service of his teams for the support
               of his family was unwilling to be separated from his teams and have them entrusted to
               the care of a waggonmaster in whom he had no confidence to travel over a road almost
               impassable and on which accidents were daily happining reference to the price given
               for trains to supply the plan of claimants it will be seen how much loss was
               sustained in consequence of claimants teams being withdrawn from the service. That
               sum he is willing shall be deducted from his claim should any appear no loss it is
               believed could have been sustained in consequence of detension of Indians had they
               been detained which he deems that they were for they arrived at Fort Cass tenness
               several months before they were required to move west claimant admits after capt
               Collins refused to pay him the amount due he gave the captain some cause of offence
               by having a writ issued against him from the Inferior Court of Macon Cty NC but
                  <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">if</unclear> in that <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">errred</unclear> he thinks the capt <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">arn erred</unclear> as much in refusing to submit to
               a civil process of the state as he did in having it issued he is willing to admit
               both done wrong. he hopes his claim will be examined on its own merits and that
               justice may be done him. he alledges if the contract refered to be produced it will
               be found different from the description given of it by the captain thereof on
               requests that you will have the contract brought before you that it may accompany the
               papers in relation to the claim as I shall leave for the west</p>

               1835 That justice might be done to the Cherokees remaining east for whom I act as
               atto in fact I have been compelled to make out a report to the commissioner
               exhibiting herein the amount due them under all the provisions of the treaty I find
               in the aggregate it amounts to upwards of $200000 of which sum the ambiguity of the
               treaty makes $50000 some what uncertain and the responsibility of mentaining their

               claims have been reported to the secretary of war so soon as his action thereon is

               anticipate that I will be able to leave here by the 15th Inst but may be detained

            <p>sir. I beg leave to submit for your consideration the following remarks on the
               accompanying claims of Cherokees for property sold</p>
            <p>It seemed by the treaty of 1835 that the sale of Cherokee property was not authorized
               nor does it appear to have been within the authority or duty of the Board of
               Commissioners who acted under <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">articla</unclear>
               of that treaty and it further appears from the return of those sales that the Board
               of Commissioners never acted on or adjudicated those claims and the only thing they
               did in relation to it was to receive and remit to this office the money due the
               claimants for their property with a list of their names and amounts due to each as
               reported by the agents. I am therefore at a loss to perceive how those claims for
               property sold can be effected by the decisions of the Department or the decisions
               made by the Board of Commissioners on claims provided for under said treaty. The
               above as stated not having been provided for or adjudicated by them but if in the
               above in your opinion I have been mistaken the peculiar situation of the claimants is
               my apology very respectfully yours &amp;c</p>

            <p>Dear Sir, your letter of the 22d was received on the 30th ultima. an answer thereto
               has been delayed in hopes to be able to inform you the presise time I would return
               which I am yet unable to do. I am pleased to hear you have made the necessary
               arrangements for receiving ginsang I am aware that will require a closer attention
               than any business you have ever had charge of and has more responsibility attached to
               it as our making that article profitable to us hereafter in answering the purpposes
               of exchange &amp;c will much depend on our management of it this year. you will give
               one cent more per pound than is given by Mr. Byrson for <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">N J.</unclear> Jarrett but you will pay in goods until I return or
               otherwise instruct you. By a letter received from Mr Fisher I presume the new goods
               have been received before this time which will be marked and sold as previously
               instructed. As to the sale of lands formly owned A Eulor deceased which you mention
               will take place on the last monday in this month. I now calculate returning before
               that time but should I ascertain that I will not have the opportunity of doing so
               will in the meantime inform you thereof The request of Mr Scroop Eulor I will
               endeavor to have complied with The questions involving a large amount due to the
               Cherokees remaining have been by the Commisioner of I. A. submitted to the Secretary
               of War for his decision thereon which is daily expected on the receipt of which I
               will be able to inform you when I will leave this place for home. The great
               responsibilty resting on me taking into consideration the large amount involved has
               compelled me to remain and give thereto my contant attention. But if my agents
               entrusted with my business at home discharge their duties faithfully I shall have no
               occasion to regret being absent and the probaility is I shall at no distant period

            <p>Sir I have the honor herewith to enclose you powers of attorney from John F.

               Felix Axley, George W Candler, and Nicholas Woodfin of NC Lawyers who claim

            <p>but I am careful not to expose myself any more than I can avoid. your letter of the
               29th ultima was this day (10) received. the request of Mr. Scroop Eulor as to writing
               to James W guinn was this day complied with. I am in hopes the reasons set forth in
               my letter will induce him to suspend the sale as requested lest my communication
               should not reach him at the proper place I have written two letters one to Franklin
               the other to Waynesville. There seems to be a discrepency in your statements of the
               time of sale in your communication of the 22d ultima you state it will take place on
               the last monday in August and in the last on the 14th I presume the last date has an
               allusion to the sales in Macon County. Inform mother of the receipt of this letter
               and its contents so far as related to my health &amp; business here. give my
               respescts to Mr. Eulor and inquiring friends I am in hopes I shall never have
               occasion to remain so long from home I am certain I shall not consistent with my
               desire I will write the Indians mother and you in a few days</p>

            <p>Mrs Elizabeth Woodard your favor of the 12th instant was duly received in relation to

               allowed by the board of commissioners are now undergoing an investigation by the
               commissioner of Indian Affairs until his report is made thereon and receives the
               sanction of the secretary of war no payment will be made which will probably require
               until some time in October. knowing your great anxiety to leave for the west when I
               first came here I tried to procure your claim to be taken up separately and explained
               to the commisioner and secretary of war your situation and the long time you had been
               waiting for the payment of your dues but I was informed that my request could not be
               complied with and that the decisions of the commissioners as to their being final
               under the treaty must first be decided. I was therefore under those circumstances to
               let your claim with all others wait the final decision when made your business will
               receive my earliest attention. The only danger to be apprehended in your case I
               conceive to be delay</p>
            <p>I have also filed your claim for commutation of removal and subsistence ($53.33 1/3)
               which I am in hopes I will gain for you. I would have written to you before but in my

            <p>Dear sir. contrary to my expectations I have remained here until the present time but
               will leave for home in a few days your arguments and protests in the reservation
               claims have been by the consent of the commissioner of Indian Affairs filed in the
               respective cases for which they were intended. I also asked the commissioner to
               adjudicate your claims against Cherokee reserves for services rendered in preparing
               their claims but he seems to be of opinion that the Department has not authority
               under the treaty to do so. at the same time sees no objection after the claims are
               disposed of to making payment on powers of attorney duly authenticated the only
               danger to be apprehended is now the reservees who to avoid paying their lawyers may
               when they ascertain the commissioner has made his decision revoke former powers of
               attorney and give new ones but it is possible the Department may not suffer them to
               do so. yet I deem it expedient that we should keep a sharp look out some of the
               reservees have already been writing to the Department respecting their claims (some
               of your clients Wm Blythe for one) The commissioner is to inform me immediately after
               the decision is made and I shall hold myself in readiness to return to this place as
               soon as possible thereafter and unless otherwise instructed by you will attend to
               your claims as well as my own I am now of opinion the commissioner will decide that
               all the claims acted on by the Board of Commissioners were within the scope of their
               authority under the treaty and their decisions therefore are final.</p>

               commissioner is of opinion that the Department has no authority under the treaty to

               presume there will be no objections to making payment on the powers of attorney where
               they are properly authenticated as to the claims being lost I have no reason to
               induce me to come to any such conclusion the government intends carrying out the

               under or provided for by the treaty are also submitted for your examination</p>
            <p>In pursuance of my instructions I beg leave to ask payment on those claims and
               respectfully to request that the amount due thereon be deducted from the amount of
               money to be sent to the Cherokees west and that the proper entries in relation
               thereto be made on the Cherokee books now filed in the office of the Commissioner of
               Indian Affairs</p>
            <p>One claim above refered to for commutation of removal and subsistence amounting to
               $53.33 1/3 each when payment is made thereon I am authorised to deposit the money
               with the government of the United state or in the state Bank of North Carolina
               appliable alone to the purposes for which it was intended. And that hereafter as the
               Cherokees remaining desire to join their brethren at their new homes west of the
               Mississippi and enroll their names for that</p>

            <p>purpose the amount due those enrolling may be furnished them under such regulations
               as the Department may be pleased to adopt whereas the above sum provided by the
               treaty for the removal of the Cherokees to their western homes and subsisting them
               one year after their arrival was found to be insufficient to answer those purposes
               And whereas the Congress of the United states on the 2d of June 1838 made an
               additional appropriation of $1147.067 to be given as a donation to the Cherokees for
               removal and subsistence and to satisfy all claims on the Us not provided for by the
               treaty and for furnishing the destitute with clothing &amp;c</p>
            <p>on the conditions that the Cherokee shall complete their emigration within such time
               as the President shall deem reasonable and without coercion on the part of the
               government. And whereas the Cherokees still remaining east were included in the
               number for whom the appropriation was made as is shown by the estimate furnished by
               the Indian Department upon which an additional sum was asked for the Cherokees and
               were equally instilled thereto with those of their brethren who emigrated in the
               summer and fall of 1838. And whereas the President of the United states has not

            <p>In conclusion may I be permitted to mention a conversation I had with you last spring
                  <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">urn</unclear> in company with Mr Churchwell
               of Tennessee I then informed you of the desires of the Cherokees remaining east that
               they wished to be permitted to remain east under the provisions of the treaty and
               allowed to join their brethren at their new homes west of the Mississippi as they
               made it their choice without any coercion on the part of the government</p>
            <p>It was probable a portion of them would desire to emigrate this fall who would wish
               to be furnished with removal and subsistence allowance in time to enable them to do
               so. If I am not mistaken I had the pleasure to be informed their requests would be
               complied with by the Department and that I might so inform the Cherokees in
               accordance therewith I informed them of the liberal proposals of the government. And
               whereas the time is now fast approaching when those who remove this fall must
               commence their journey I would respectfully ask the attention of the Department to
               this subject as early as consistent with convenience yours &amp;c</p>

            <p>Sir. having received no answers from you to my various communications I wrote to the
               post master at Utica to ascertain if you had left the city and if my letters were

               received my other letters I directed to Utica, you are thereby informed of my
               situation and my delay here awaiting an answer from you. And if I am much longer
               detained by your neglect I shall be under the necessity of charging you on our
               settlement with the losses I sustain thereby which if you are unwilling to be
               answerable for I shall expect to be informed thereby by return mail in case I am not
               and am delayed here much longer I shall presume you are willing to allow me the

               whom I had a right to expect better treatment and would yet hope if I could with
               facts starring me in the face that I had been mistaken I am not aware that I have
               given you any cause of offence or ever treated you improper if I have I have no
               knowledge of it but on the contrary when I last saw you in this city you met me as a
               friend I treated you as such and I would yet rejoice to receive a satisfactory

            <p>Sir</p>
            <p>I perceive in the report of the Hon Commissioner of Indian Affairs of the 12th Inst
               that rolls will be required of the Cherokees east preparatory to making payment to
               them of their dues under the treaty of 1835 &amp; 6. And whereas I am the attorney in
               fact of these Cherokees as is evidenced by their powers of attorney filed in your
               office may I be permitted to request the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">wills</unclear> of the Commissioner in that respect be carried into effect as
               soon as possible not only to ascertain the number of those who will have to be paid
               east but the number that wish to emigrate this fall which will enable the Department
               to make the necessary arrangements respecting them</p>
            <p>Whereas the Cherokee chiefs agreed on the plan of taking the census of the Cherokees
               who remained east under the provisions of the 12th article of the treaty I beg leave
               to submit it for the consideration of the Department</p>
            <p>&quot;That the number belonging to each town and settlement be accurately ascertained
               two acting justices of the peace in and for the counties in which they reside shall
               annually make out &amp; certify a list belonging to each town which list shall be
               certified by the clerk and Chairman of the County Court.&quot;</p>
            <p>In addition thereto I would respectfully recommend that the interpreter be sworn to
               discharge his duties faithfully and that each head of a family be required to state
               his voluntary choice to remain east or go west and the census further show all those

            <p>Your kind favor of the 4 inst was duly received permit me to express my sincere
               regret for the irreparable loss you have sustained in being deprived of a beloved
               wife and an affectionate mother but as this is sooner or later the the fate of all
               the human family we should prepare to follow departed relatives and cherish a hope
               which marches beyond the grave</p>

               that of Andrew Welch Jesse Berny, Geo W Hayes J W King, Samuel Sherrill Ten &amp;c
               upon your view of the situation of the entries I am inclined to think reentering is
               advisable in my own name. my object in making these entries is known to you and
               therefore needs no explanation</p>
            <p>I have succeeded in obtaining a decision of the commissioner of Indian Affairs on the
               claims of the Oconalufta Indians and all others remaining east to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">periapilia</unclear> allowance which will be set

               amounting to about $53,000 The commissioner decided against <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">me</unclear> but I have since showed him reasons to
               grant me a reconsideration of that claim. If he again decides against me I will then
                  <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">appeall</unclear> to the secretary of war, I
               know the Cherokees <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">east</unclear> are honestly

               and in answer of the commissioners objections to paying it</p>
            <p>The Commissioner has not yet completed his report on the business <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">transacted</unclear> by the Board of Commissioners
               but I <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">pusume</unclear> he will finish it by the

            <p>Dear Sir</p>
            <p>Contrary to my expectations I am yet here and will probably have to remain until the
               first of next month, one claim for commutation of removal and subsistence due the
               Cherokees east amounting in the aggregate to about 55,000 as was sometimes <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">since</unclear> reported against by the Commissioner
               of Indian Affairs, but I afterwards procured a reconsideration of the claims, and
               have for some time been preparing evidence in support of it, and answering the
               objections urged by the commissioner against its being allowed, should he again
               decide against it, I will then appeal to the secretary of War who is now absent and
               is not expected to return before the first of next month their claims for
               improvements, <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">specifications per capita
                  &amp;c</unclear> have been decided in their favor amounting in the aggregate to
               about $150,000,00. and the money will be set apart for their benefit most of it
               placed on interest.</p>
            <p>In relation to Eulor lands that i wrote you respecting <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">sometime since</unclear>. I have to request that you will do me the
               kindness for reasons before stated to delay the sale until a short time after I come
               home. I think it will be an advantage to all parties, I will talk to the Treasurer
               respecting it on my return. I presume you are informed that the Oconalufta road has
               been <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">received</unclear>, I design making a
               settlement respecting it as go home. I dericted a report of the commissioners who
               received the road to be sent to the treasurer for that purpose.</p>
            <p>I tried to employ a lawyer here to attend to my business but found none who knew
               anything of the Cherokees or the treaties made with them. Therefore I was compelled
               to remain or suffer claims to be lost for want of explanation</p>
            <p>your name is beginning to be talked of here as one expected to pay them a visit in a

               commutation of removal and subsistence <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">will</unclear> the first of next week should he decide to allow the claims will

               returned home but have been unable to find any who seem to know anything of the
               Cherokee treaties. By remaining I am of opinion I shall gain the claim which amounts
               in the aggregate to to about $55000.00 but should I loose it I shall then have
               discharged my duty as anyone should do who has business confided to him</p>

            <p>Dear sir, I came on here some time since as attorney in fact for 1046 Cherokees
               remaining East in the states of georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee under the
               provisions of the 12th article of the treaty of 1835. One claim to which they are
               entitled as a commutation of removal and subsistence amounting to 53.33 each in the
               aggregate to about $55,000.00 (a small number has been paid commutation) I am
               authorised to deposit with the government on in some Bank or interest to be
               applicable alone for the purpose for which it was intended and hereafter as any of
               these unfortunate people shall desire to join their brethren at their new homes west
               of the Mississippi the means can be furnished them under such regulations as the
               Department may think proper to adopt At this time but a very small number wish to go,
               and until the existing difficulties with their brethren west are settled it is
               probably best for them to remain east, and as they are mostly settled on lands they
               have purchased they can do so without any inconvenience. Before any arrangements can
               be made it will be too late for the few that under the circumstances might desire to
               remove to go this fall therefore none will remove before next. As the Rail Road Bank
               of georgia is as <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">convenient</unclear> as any
               other <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Advent</unclear> Bank will you please
               ascertain of the President and directors if they would receive not less than
               $50,000.00 nor exceeding $100000 on deposit for the aforementioned purposes. if so
               what interest they would be willing to pay annually for the use of it. their proposal
               I can then lay before the Hon secretary of War on his return which will be the first
               of next</p>

            <p>The acting secretary of War Maj Cooper informs me you have been written to on the

               possible</p>

            <p>Dear sir,</p>
            <p>The business of the Cherokees remaining east has detained me me much longer than I
               anticipated and I will be unable to complete my business until the return of the Hono
               secretary of War which is supposed to be the first of next month</p>
            <p>Whereas I am authorised to deposit in the State Bank of North Carolina or some other
               safe institution the money due the Cherokees remaining east Will you please ascertain
               of the president and directors of that Bank if they will <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">reive</unclear> not less than $50,000.00 nor exceeding $100,00000 on
               deposit if so what percent they are willing to pay annually for the use of it. none
               of the principal will be required only as those Cherokees who have become citizens of
               the state desire to emigrate and join their people at their new homes west of the
               Mississippi therefore none will be wanting before next fall and then it is probable
               but a small amount those people having made their choice to remain it is not
               presumable that they will change their opinion only as influenced by information
               received from their friends in the west. When you are informed by the Bank in
               relation to the above will you please enclose me their propositions that I may lay it
               before the secretary of war on his return</p>
            <p>you will perceive my plan is to remove those Cherokees who have been permitted to
               remain and become citizens under the provisions of the 12 article of the treaty of
               1835 as they desire to go and to have the money due them placed on interest for that
               purpose but at the same time I propose to do nothing without their consent. This was
               the ancient policy of the government and both whites and Indians have much reason to
               regret that it it was ever departed from many valuable lives would have been saved
               and a large amount of money in the treasury. yours &amp;c</p>

            <p>The causes which have lead to my long delay here I presume you have been informed of
               by the communications addressed to the Cherokees at your office since those were
               written nothing has occured to change my opinion as to the probable time I will yet
               be detained here</p>
            <p>your claim on the United states for the sum of $506.00 has been collected which you
               will charge to my account upon reflection I am inclined to think I gave you no
               receipt for the claim and to provide for the uncertainties to which all are liable
               the above is given</p>
            <p>I have enjoyed good health since here and am at present in good health. I am in hopes
               in a short time I shall have the pleasure of seeing you all again and to such as you

            <p>As agent of the Cherokee Indians remaining in the state of North Carolina under the
               provisions of the 12 article of the treaty of 1835. May I be permitted to make known
               to you the arrangements made <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">arn</unclear>
               which I am authorised to make for their removal hereafter as they may desire to join
               their brethren at their new homes west of the Mississippi and respectfully to request
               your opinion in relation thereto</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1836 the Cherokee remaining in the state made known to the general
               Assembly then in session their desire to remain in the state subject to her laws and
               if the state was willing for them to do so, requested the passage of such laws as
               they in their wisdom deemed necessary for their protection. they also informed the
               general Assembly that the money due them under the treaty of 1835 as a commutation of
               removal &amp; subsistence would be placed on interest for the purpose for for which
               it was intended. Their request was granted and a law passed for their protection to
               which I beg leave to refer you Acts 1836 &amp; 7 Cap 8. I now have the pleasure to
               inform you that I am authorised by those Cherokees to receive their money due
               from</p>

            <p>the United States and to deposit it in the state Bank of North Carolina or some other
               safe institution applicable to the purposes of removing and subsisting one year after
               their arrival all who may subsequently desire to remove to the lands assigned them
               west of the Mississipppi. In doing this it is deemed that they have acted in good
               faith and in accordance with correct policy such as it is hoped will meet the
               approbation of that state in which they reside, whose statute Books have never been
               disgraced by Lesislative enactments calculated to oppress or distress the poor and
               unfortunate Indians within her territory But on the contrary granted their humble
               request, and extended around them the protection of her laws In doing this the not
               only caused the hearts of several hundred of this unfortunate race to rejoice, but

            <p>I have been detained here much longer than I anticipated but I have no reason to
               regret it and am in hopes you will have none that I done so. It required a
               considerable length of of time to make out all your claims for property sold,
               improvements <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">speliations</unclear>, commutation
               for removal and subsistence and per capita all of which I have made out and exhibited
               to the Department and have procured a favorable decision on all except the claim for
               commutation which the Commissioner reported against the payment of a few days since.
               But he has since agreed to allow me the the privilege of filing additoinal evidence
               in support of the claims and to give it a reconsideration</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding he is of opinion none who do not intend to remove are entitled to
               commutation for removal and subsistence he is nevertheless willing to allow all such
               as do remove that allowance but thinks a longer time than this fall ought not to be
               given to make their choice (But notwithstanding all that I have no fears of that
               claim)</p>
            <p>Should the commissioner of Indian Affairs on a reconsideration of that claim for
               commutation of removal and subsistence again decide against it I will then take an
               appeal to the Hon J R Poinsett secretary of War who is now absent but will return by
               the first of next month but if the commissioner decides in its favor I will start
               home immediately afterwards</p>

            <p>It is probable the money due the full blooded Cherokees the Department may require
               placed on interest for their benefit. It is also probable payment will be delayed
               until those Cherokees who emigrated last fall have been subsisted the length of time
               promised under the treaty after their arrival in the Cherokee Country west, previous
               to that time it is thought that the per capita cannot be ascertain</p>
            <p>If any of your people have come to reside with you whose names were not on the power
               of attorney I made out and who wish to remain east have a power of attorney made out
               for them after the manner of these I made out for you only instead of one justice of
               the peace have it acknowledged by two and let them certify that those signing desire
               of their own choice to remain east and also let them certify as to the number of each
               family signing (then have it certified by the Clerk and Chairman of the County
               Court)</p>
            <p>And should any of your people of their own choice desire to emigrate this fall have a
               list made out of their names and number in each of their families which with the
               above power of attorney have enclosed to me at this place by mail marked on the back
               of the letter list of Cherokees. In case I leave before it arrives I will get the
               commissioner of Indian Affairs to have it attended to the interpreter in both cases
               will be sworn by the justiced to speak the intentions of the Cherokee to remove or
               remain which will also be certified by those Justices. But let the interpreter inform
               them at the same time if they make it their choice to remove and have their names
               entered on the list of those desiring to go they must prepare to do so for on the
               commissioner receiving that list will be transfered west. The reason of my wishing
               this attended to is in consequence of a report having reached here from georgia that
               all of you desired to remove west this fall which if untrue ought immediately to be
               contradicted</p>

            <p>I have been here since I wrote you before attending to Cherokee claims arising under
               the treaty of 1835 and due to Indians remaining in the states of georgia North
               Carolina &amp; Tennessee under its provisions</p>
            <p>When I first came on here I calculated that portion of the claims which had been
               adjudicated and allowed by the Board of Commissioners would be paid immediately as by
               the terms of the treaty their decision thereon was declared to be final</p>
            <p>But the Commissioner of Indian Affairs refused to make payment until he had
               reexamined the claims made a report thereon to the sescretary of war and it received
               his sanction arising to various causes it has been delayed and will not be completed
               before sometime in next month after which I presume payment will be made immediately
               (I have lost no claims by the investigation)</p>
            <p>As the delay had been much longer than I anticipated I thought proper to state the
               circumstances which had lead to it and to inform you as well as my other friends in
               Charleston that on all balances due from the stores in which I am interested in I am
               (as money to businessmen is with more than simple interest) willing to allow them ten
               percent interest until payment is made to molify the governmen as above stated</p>
            <p>Between fifty and a hundred thousand dollars of the money I am impowered to receive
               for the Indians I am authorised to deposit in some safe institution for their
               benefit. Will you please do me the favor to enquire of the President &amp; Directors
               of the Bank of the State of South Carolina if they would</p>

            <p>receive the money on deposit if so what amount of interest they are willing to pay
               for the use of it</p>
            <p>No payment will be required to be made until the expiration of twelve months after
               the money is deposited at which time the interest with a portion of the principal
               will be required and annually afterwards until the purposes of the Indians shall
               required the withdrawal of the whole sum which will in all probability not take place
               under ten years Should they think proper to make a proposal will you please enclose
               it to me at this place that I may lay it before the secretary of war to ascertain his
               opinion in relation thereto yours &amp;c</p>

            <p>Dear sir. I have been here since last spring attending to the claims of Cherokees the
               commissioner of Indian Affairs has not yet completed his report on the reservations
               acted on by the Board of Commissioners but expects to complete it by the first day of
               next month until then but little can be known respecting. It is presumable however
               that he will decide that by the stipulations of the treaty the decisions made by the
               Board of Commissioners on claims which were provided for under the treaty are
               final</p>
            <p>The claim forwarded to the commissioner of Indian Affairs by Mrs Morgan for
               commutation of removal and subsistence allowance with some I filed of the same
               description have been disallowed by him he has since granted me the privilege of
               filing additional evidence in support of the claims, and promised to give the subject
               a reconsideration</p>
            <p>Should he again decide against the claims I will appeal on those I have charge of to
               the secretary</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="0012_000590_000204_0101.jpg" xml:id="d3e3357"/>
            <p>of War and thought it probable you would wish to have an appeal taken on yours also.
               If you do and think proper to enclose me a power of attorney I will take an appeal on
               your claim and attend to any other business you may desire before the Department</p>
            <p>In case there be any Cherokees in your neighborhood who desire to remain and become
               citizens of the state. If you will get them to sign a power of attorney to me I will
               I will make out and file for them their claims for commutation, per capita &amp;c.
               But it must be attended to immediately or it will be too late. they must be filed in
               time to have the amount due them deducted from the amount of money to be sent west.
               The secretary of war informed me no force would be used to remove the few Cherokees
               remaining east and he permitted me so to inform them. And should any of their own
               choice desire to remove west this fall they will be furnished with removal and
               subsistence</p>
            <p>If Dr Hanks has not attended to his claims and that of his family for percapita
               &amp;c he should attend to it immediately unless he has concluded to remove west
               before next spring</p>
            <p>Should you think proper to make out a power of attorney to send me as before refered
               to, have it drawn in the usual way embracing all claims provided for under the treaty
               of 1835 have it interpreted by a sworn interpreter which must also be certified by
               the justices. after which have it certified by the clerk and chairman of the county
               court</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="0012_000590_000204_0102.jpg" xml:id="d3e3370"/>
            <p>As a small portion of the Cherokees were permitted to remain by the superindent in
               pursuance of instructions from the secretary of war it may become necessary to have
               the age of the claimants stated as near it can be ascertained</p>

            <p>Dear sir. Mr Starritt informs me he left my horse with you as I had instructed him.
               Until I come on you will please have him fed as becomes necessary previous to
               starting a journey. I am at present unable to inform you when I can leave here. The
               commissioner of Indian Affairs has decided in favor of all the claims I had to attend
               to for the Cherokees except one for commutation amounting in the aggregate to
               $55,000.00 that he has decided against but since has allowed me the privilege of
               filing additional evidence and and has promised to reconsider his opinion in relation
               thereto should he on a reconsideration decide in favor of it I will start home
               immediately afterwards. If he again decides against it I will then take an appeal to
               the secretary of war which will detain me probably two weeks longer. I should have
               employed a lawyer here to attend to my business &amp; and returned home but can find
               none who know anything of the Cherokees or treaties made with them give my respects

            <p>Dear sir. The claim due you the collection of which was entrusted to me has not been
               paid. At one time I was fearful it would be lost for reasons you were not apprised of
               but which I will explain to you on my return. At present I dont think there is any
               danger of losing it but payment will be suspended until the return of the secretary
               of war which is expected by the first of next month payment on all claims has been
               &amp; will be suspended for the present</p>
            <p>I shall loose nothing by the claims being investigated except the delay which has
               been the consequence thereof</p>
            <p>One claim due the Cherokees for commutation of removal and subsistence the

               thereto. Should he on reconsideration decide in favor of it I will start home
               immediately but if he again decides against it I will then take an appeal on it to
               the secretary of war which may detain me until the middle of next month I would have
               employed a lawyer here to attend to my business and returned home but could find none
               who seemed acquainted with the treaties made with the Cherokees. informed him I had

            <p>Sept 29, 1839</p>
            <p>Dear sir. Contrary to my expectations I have remained here until the present time.
               After I had finished making out Cherokee claims and filed them (about 3000) the
               commissioner of Indian Affairs reported in favour of all except the due for
               commutation of removal and subsistence they in the aggregate amounted to $55,000.00 I
               afterwards obtained permission to file additional evidence in support of the claims
               and the commissioner promised to reconsider his opinion in relation thereto. If he
               again decides against it I will then take an appeal to the secretary of war who will
               probably refer it to the Atto general</p>
            <p>As relates to our reservation cases the report thereon is not yet completed by I am
               informed by the commissioner it will be finished next week and will then be submitted
               to the secretary of war until then but little will be known respecting it. I presume
               you need have no fears of any claims being rejected which had been allowed by the
               Board of Commissioners. My present opinion is that their decision will be regarded as
               final</p>
            <p>Aapplied to the commissioner for permission to file John F gillaspie&apos;s
               argugments and yours in the cases for which they were intended. he granted the
               permission and they have been filed accordingly. I also filed a letter before the
               Department requesting that the claims of Lawyers (I represented) for services
               rendered the Cherokees in in preparing and attending to their reservation claims
               might be considered and judgment awarded thereon agreeable to the evidence in
               relation thereto.</p>
            <p>But the commissioner is of opinion that the Department under the treaty has no right
               to adjudicate those claims. he informed me though at the same time that he presumed
               there would be no objections to making payment on powers of attorney properly
               authenticated (Equitable fees) John Ross and company wrote on how last summer
               requesting further claims under the treaty be paid until they could make some
               arrangements among themselves and some of the reservees whose claims you and
               gillaspie attended to have</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="0012_000590_000204_0105.jpg" xml:id="d3e3443"/>
            <p>been writing to the Department respecting their claims. you will perceive the danger
               I apprehend is subsequent power of attornies revoking those formerly given. I
               therefore thought it might be advisable for me to remain and apply for payment as
               soon as the decision of the secretary of war is obtained on the commissioners report
               I will write you immediately afterwards and let you know all the particulars</p>
            <p>I am of opinion there will be a chance of gaining a considerable number of the
               rejected claims but I think it best not to set them up until those allowed are paid
               should you meet any person in Knoxville who thinks proper to inquire about me give my
               respects to them (I mention the above for your own information only.) yours

            <p>The draft you enclosed me of $8,000 on the gentlemen in the patent office had been
               presented but nothing paid on it. Mr Knowles sais you directed him to build some on a
               chimery which will exceed the amount he borrowed of you and another very good reason
               he assigns is the want of the money the other gentlemen sais you are indebted to him
               he has left the office but is yet in the city. I thought proper to inform you in

            <p>Dear sir the commissioner of Indian Affairs has not yet completed his report on
               claims for reservations and other claims acted on by the Board of Commissioners under
               the treaty of 1835 but he probably will in a few days until after it receives the
               action of the secretary of war very little can be known respecting the final decision
               on your reservation claim. I have obtained a decision on your claim for per capita
               which I filed with the claims of the Cherokees residing in North Carolina that will
               be paid but payment cannot be made until the Cherokees who last emigrated have been
               subsisted the length of time promised under the treaty which will expire some time
               next winter after which it will require some time to make the proper estimates to
               enable the Department to know the sum to be divded as per capita yours &amp;c</p>

            <p>Dear sir the causes which have lead to my long delay here I presume you have been
               informed of I now think it probable I will not be able to leave here before the 20th
               Inst I presume I shall by remaining accomplish as much for the Cherokees East as I
               had a right to expect</p>
            <p>It seems that the Banks are commencing another general suspension of specie payments
               they have nearly all suspended in Philadelphia and on yesterday all suspended in
               Baltimore and today they suspended here. I thought it advisable to inform you thereof
               and to suggest the propriety of your making an arrangement with Capt <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Jarrit</unclear> for the payment of the debts I
               contracted for you in Philadelphia which fall due in the first of next month but what
               is due to Siter Price and Co. they dont expect before next spring the balances are to
               be paid when they become due I have made the above suggestions in hopes of preventing
               probable loss on exchange which will no doubt be occasioned by the Banks having
               suspended (you need pay Price Newlin &amp; co only $300, yours &amp;c W H T</p>

               recolection of it) If the above sum satisfies the note please receipt it and enclose
               it to me at this place. And if you can ascertain I would be much obliged to you to be
               informed of the difference now made in Philadelphia between notes on the Bank of the
               United States and the notes on the Bank of the State of NCarolina</p>

            <p>I have a considerable amount of claims on the government of the United States which
               have been examined &amp; allowed and I presume will be paid sometime in the last of

               like to exchange a small amount of North Carolina funds (2000$) The Banks suspended

            <p>The causes which have lead to my long delay here I presume you have been informed of
               by remaining I shall <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">suced</unclear> in

               about $150000. Their claim for commutation of removal &amp; subsistence amounting to
               $55,000 was rejected by the commissioner of Indian Affairs he afterwards agreed to
               reconsider his opinion in relation thereto and now has it under consideration he will
               probably make a decision thereon about the 15th or 20th Inst If in favor of the claim
               I will start home immediately but if he again decides against it I will then take an
               appeal to the secretary of War which will detain me several days longer. I have
               written to Daniel Bryson Esqr and requested him to examine the ginsang taken in at
               shoal creek and in case it has been well managed, requested that it be sent on

               here to attend to my business and returned home but could find none acquainted with

            <p>Dear sir. Mr Crawford&apos;s long looked for report is not yet completed. he has been
               so often deceived. I deem it unnecessary to give you any further information on his
               supposed times for the completion suffise it to say when made I will inform you
               thereof with the particulars in relation thereto. I have had no reasons to change my
               opinions before expressed as to what will be his final decision and that of the
               Department.</p>
            <p>I have remained here all the time since I came on first and think it probable I shall
               not desert my post until finally disposed of. Mr Rogers is yet here but talks of
               going south shortly as to that I consider it uncertain. I presume you have been
               informed of his taking to himself a wife for that you can draw all the necessary
               inferences. The Banks have suspended specie payment in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and
               all in the city except one (Patriotic Bank) In New York they have not yet suspended
               and if they do not other Banks that have must resume or be ruined. The Metropolis
               Bank it is reported will resume tomorrow (at this place) no doubt the suspension has
               measurably been occasioned by some political juglers to verify the prophecies they
               have made yours &amp;c</p>

            <p>Dear sir. your favor of the 12th Inst was received by this mornings mail. In relation
               to your coming here I at present unable to advise you of the time your presence here
               will be necessary as the commissioner of Indian Affairs has not as</p>

            <p>yet completed his long looked for report. I presume he has it in contemplation to
               have it prepared to submit to the secretary of war in a few days but in the time it
               was to be completed he has been so often deceived I deem it unnecessary to set any
               time as the probable one. When made I will inform you thereof with the particulars in
               relation thereto. Then and not until then can I inform you of the time you should
               come on I think it probable though it will not be necessary before the meeting of
               Congress</p>
            <p>As relates to the revocation of the powers of attorney mentioned in my communication
               refered to, I perceive you did not fully understand my meaning for want of a proper
               explanation. suppose by way of illustration A. a Cherokee gives a power of attorney
               to B. a white man and then the claims are finally settled and payment to be made by
               the United States. suppose A should object to the money due him being paid to B on
               his power of attorney on the ground that by the terms of the treaty it was to be paid
               to him in person the question would then have to be submitted to the attorney general
               to decide whether or not the treaty required payment to be made in that manner in the
               want of his deciding it did I was at a loss to perceive how the law to the contrary
               could be of any advantage the treaty being the Supreme law of the land. By proper
               attention as I have before observed I am inclined to think we will have nothing to
               fear from that quarter The reconsideration of the claim of the Cherokees I represent
               for commutation of removal and subsistence allowance amounting to about $55,000 will
               be taken up the last of next week the ground upon which it was previousl rejected by
               the commisioner (of Indian Affairs) was by confining the construction to the letter
               of the treaty &amp; refusing to admit any interpretation founded on the intention of
               the contracting parties while preparing that claim for reconsideration I have
               attached thereto a claim for preemptions amounting to upwards of $100,000 that if the
               construction be confined</p>
            <pb n="113" facs="0012_000590_000204_0113.jpg" xml:id="d3e3668"/>
            <p>to the letter must be allowed for it was previously rejected by admitting an
               interpretation founded on a supposed intention of the contracting parties and as the
               former decision was exparta I I though I would give it another trial</p>
            <p>Mr Rogers is still here but has troubled himself verry little about business since
               you left here his attention as you can well imagine has had a different direction he
               talks of going to the south in a short time but as to his doing so I consider it very
               much like Mr Crawords time of finishing his report uncertain</p>

               their claim for commutation amounting to $55,000 had been rejected but the
               commissioner had agreed to reconsider his opinion in relation thereto I have prepared
               the case and expect a decision in a few days if in favor of the claim will start home

            <p>Dear sir the decisions of the Department on the claims of Cherokees refered to in my
               last communication have not yet been made until then I cannot inform you of the time
               I will start home. I have written to Mr Daniel Bryson requesting him to examine the
               sang taken in at your place and in case it was such as he thought would be received
               by Dr Heflin to state to you that I wanted it sent on with Mr r Jarretts to whom I
               have written on the subject I supposed Mr Bryson best qualified to inspect the sang
               as he had been for several years receiving it for the doctor and new best the
               description he would receive. It will be necessary that you purchase if you have not
               done so a sufficient quantity of oats and fodder to last until the same articles are
               raised. for goods on discount of debts not due which were contracted for trade
               articles (which must now be low as everything else is) If you can purchase a
               sufficient quantity of goods bricks to build a chimney anyplace convenient make the
               purchase and have them hauled and started &amp; covered near where the new house is
               building and if anything else is needed for it have it got and hauled. Keep
               everything moving so as not to incur unnecessary expenses. The apples which belongs

               now is not completed. But from the near approach of congress it must be shortly My
               previous opinions have not changed in relation thereto except as to time that has
               been extended to a much later period than I anticipated. Betsy Woodard arrived here a

               giving attention to it until paid in which went I hope to have no difficulty in

            <p>Dear sir the commissioner of Indian Affairs has not yet completed his decisions on
               claims refered to in my last communication but judging from the near approach of
               Congress and the time which will be required in making out his annual report I
               presume he will complete it in a short time. In the event of his deciding in favor of
               allowing the claims for removal &amp; subsistence I will start home immediately but
               if he decides against it I will then take an appeal to the secretary of war. In that
               case I may be detained until towards the last of next month. I have just finished an
               argument in support of the rights of Cherokees East 50 pages in length I have
                  <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">embraced</unclear> therein the claim for
               compensation for preemption which was rejected by the commissioner of Indian Affairs
               on an opinion given by the attorney general in 1838. On examination of the ground
               upon which it had been rejected, I perceived the decision had been made ex parta no
               evidence having been furnished in favor of the claimants should I fail to gain that
               claim it will then be in as good a situation when I took it up and it may be an
               advantage to the claim for removal &amp; subsistence. If the Department confine the
               construction of the treaty to the letter then the preemption claim must be allowed
               which in value would be at least $60,000 If the construction be be admitted founded
               on interpretation agreeable to the intention of the contracting parties then upon
               that construction the claim for removal and subsistence must be allowed amounting to
               $55,000 (I give this as my opinion</p>
            <p>As my long absence might to some extent operate prejudicial to your interest from
               receipt of this letter whatever terms we agree on may be regarded as commencing from
               and after that time on as soon thereafter as you can make the necessary arrangements
               preparatory thereto I mention the above only to show you I am willing to place you in
               the same situation as if I had returned at the time anticipated on my return it is my
               intention to so dispose of my business that I will have some less to attend to
               myself</p>

               not already paid should be paid as soon as possible. By a letter received from Mr

            <p>The commissioner has not completed his report on reservation claims but from the near
               approach of Congress he will in a short time as to the result my opinion is the same
               as I have previously expressed to you. While waiting on the commissioners decision I
               have prepared a general explanation of the rights of Cherokees East in which I have
               embraced the claim for compensation for preemption rights which was rejected by the
               commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1838 upon an opinion given by the Attorney general.
               Since here I have examined the grounds upon which that opinion was founded and find
               no evidence had been previously filed in favor of the claimaints. If I loose it then
               it will only be in the situation if was before taken up and if I gain it thereby will
               be added to the money due those East between $50 and 100 thousand dollars. John A
               Bell and Stan <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">watia</unclear> arrived here a

            <p>from Arkansaw they represent the Cherokees in that country as in a state of great
               exitement and confusion. The government of the United States has taken preparatory
               measures to making a demand of the murderers of the Ridges and Boudinott. what will
               be the result of that affair is at present uncertain until it is settled it is not
               deemed expedient for any of the Cherokees East to remove west, nor is it probable any
               arrangment will be made for them to do so. Provided however if the Cherokees West
               become reconciled with each other before next fall I presume arrangments will then be
               made for such as of their own choice as may desire to remove but they will be left to
               choose for themselves if they wish to continue East they will be permitted to do so
               and will be paid their dues under the treaty on which a decision has been made and of
               which I informed you. It is highly probable payment will not be made before next
               Spring. owing to causes I have before explained The claim for commutation of removal
               and subsistence allowance for those who do not intend to remove West is now under
               consideration when disputed of I will inform you. give my respects to enquiring

               reconsideration and I think it will be paid but sometime since it was rejected for
               want of some information I was unable to give which I have since procured and thereby
               got the claim reconsidered</p>

            <p>Dear sir. your favor of the 21 st ultimo was duly received. In relation to the money
               refered to respecting which you requested to be informed I have been authorised by
               the Cherokees remaining East of the Mississippi as their atto in fact to settle with
               the United States their claims arrising under or provided for by the treaty of 1835.
               On those due for improvements, spoliations, property sold and per capita, I have
               obtained a favorable decision by the commissioner of Indian Affairs. Of the money
               payable thereon I am authorised by the claimants to have loaned to or deposited in
               some safe institution on interest a sum not less than $50,000 The interest accruing
               thereon payable annually As to the rate of interest I am unable at present to inform
               you In that as in all business confied to me by the Indians I shall be governed by
               what I conceive to be calculated to promote their true interest. The kind of funds to
               be deposited cannot at present be ascertained but is is presumable the government
               will not propose payment in any under par as to that it can make no difference for in
               payment the same kind will be received as deposited. Next Spring is as soon as I
               think it probable the deposit could be made</p>
            <p>In addition to the above those Cherokees have a claim for commutation of removal and
               subsistence amounting to $55,000 which has been rejected by the commissioner of
               Indian Affairs but he afterwards granted me a reconsideration of his opinion in
               relation thereto he now has the subject under consideration and I am waiting for his
               opinion to be made known If he decides finally in favor of the claim the money will
               be placed on interest in some safe institution. Should he again decide against it I
               will then take an appeal thereon to the secretary of war</p>

               see you on my return when I may be able to inform you more satisfatory on the subject

               of the Mississippi a printed copy of which is herewith enclosed It is intended to be

               those of your children are condensed therein under the various treaties made with the
               United. I supposed on that account if no other it might be acceptable to you and

            <p>Ross has refused to give them up preparations are making to take them by force until

            <p>Hon Wilson Lumpkin</p>
            <p>Athens georgia</p>
            <p>Dear sir. your favor of the 25th Sept was duly received an answer thereto has been
               delayed in consequence of my waiting for the commissioner of Indian Affairs to
               complete his report on Cherokee business which yet remains unfinished It is
               presumable however that from the near approach of the meeting of Congress and time
               necessary to make out his annual report that he will complete it in a short time</p>
            <p>on the first of the month I submitted an additional argument as an explanation of the
               situation and rights of the Cherokees remaining East a copy thereof is herewith
               enclosed which it is probable will give you a more general understanding of what I
               consider due them under the treaty than I could otherwise give you</p>
            <p>As those Cherokees by the terms of the treaty have the right to remain citizens of
               the states as long as they desire to do so their removal is only to be effected as
               they desire to join their brethren in the west</p>
            <pb n="126" facs="0012_000590_000204_0126.jpg" xml:id="d3e4139"/>
            <p>I therefore propose that the sum of money due them for removal and subsistence
               ($56,783.18) be placed on interest and only withdrawn as that object may require</p>
            <p>Suppose 100 should emigrate annually which is as large a number as in my opinion can
               reasonably be expected. At that rate at least ten years will be required to complete
               the removal. As an encouragement to emigration their share of the last appropriation
               intended as a donation to the Cherokees I propose also to be placed on interest

               portion of their per capita I also propose and am authorised to place on interest</p>
            <p>The proposals of the georgia Rail road Bank I consider liberal and would suggest the
               propriety of your being authorised before you come on to transact any busines in
               relation thereto that may become necessary. The commissioner of Indian Affairs
               informs me he expects to pay the Cherokees all their dues under the treaty during
               next winter I shall have to be here most my time until that business is completed.
               Should anything come to you before you come on here please inform me I should be
               plased to hear from you at all times</p>

            <p>Dear Sir,</p>
            <p>your favor of the 1st inst was received this morning in reply thereto I can inform
               you I have no acquaintance with Mr Bird the gentleman refered to. But on making the
               inquiry as requested I ascertain from Newton and Gadsley keepers of the National
               Hotel that he staid with them when in this city and by reference to their register it
               appears that he returned from New York on the 8th and left for Florida on the 10th of
               september. The gentlemen you refered me to for information have also left here. The
               decision of the Department for which I have been so long waiting will probably be
               made in a few days immediately after which I design returning home. Should I have any
               inquiring friends in Asheville please give my respects to them yours &amp;c</p>

            <p>Dear Sir on the night of your communication I called on the post office department in
               compliance with your request last night A communication was addressed to you in
               relation to the carrying the mail on the rout refered to which I presume will
                  <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JM">be</unclear> satisfactory. The arrangment
               made by you is approved of and you and instructed to continue it until further
               advised. I am waiting for the final desion on the claim for removal and subsistence
               amounting to $55,000 which was rejected in sept and on which I obtained a
               reconsideration from a conversation with the Commissioner of I A. I presume my
               business will be brought to a close in a short time immediately after will return
               home give my respects W H T</p>

            <p>Hon T. Hartley Crawford</p>
            <p>Commissioner of Indian Affairs</p>
            <p>Washington City DC</p>
            <p>Nov 12, 1839</p>
            <p>Sir, I would respectfully call your attention to your report of the 12th sept on the
               subject of the Cherokees remaining East of the Mississippi which is hereuntil
               enclosed respecting which I beg learnd to submit the following remarks</p>
            <p>At the time the request was made you seem to have deemed it unnecessary to separate
               the Cherokees East from those who had emigrated and the reason assigned is the
               probability of their removal west before the Cherokee business was settled. Upon what
               information that supposition was founded I have not been informed I presume however
               it was on a report said to have been in circulation in georgia and of which the
               Department was informed by the Hon Wilson Lumpkin who thereupon was requested to
               procure what information he could in relation to those Cherokees &amp; inform the
               Department thereof. His report has been made by which it appears that none of these
               Indians under existing <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">curcustances</unclear>
               desire to emigrate nor does he think it probable they will before next fall he does
               not deem it expedient to encourage them to go until after those west have settled
               their difficulties. That report taken in connection with the fact that the government
               has not furnished them with the means of removal and subsistence demonstrably prove
               that none will imigrate until after the Cherokee national business is closed. For by
               your report it appears that it will be completed during next winter. Therefore making
               payment to those East of what is due them under the treaty on setting it apart for
               that purpose before the Cherokee books are sent west would seem to be indispensably
               necessary without which I am at a loss to percieve how with any degree of certainty
               payment can be made them under the treaty.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="0012_000590_000204_0130.jpg" xml:id="d3e4234"/>
            <p>as the books furnish the only evidence in relation thereto. And they were not to wait
               until payment was made to those that imigrated but were intitled by the 12th article
               of the treaty to recieve all their dues provided for therein as soon as an
               appropriation was made therefor. it was made on the 2d of July 1806 three years and
               four months their money has been due from the United States and that time has elapsed
               since Congress made the appropriation to pay them</p>
            <p>So far as regards their election it seems to have been made agreeably to the
               provisions of the treaty it was upon that desire to remain East subject to the laws
               of the states that the priveledges they now enjoy were granted them. And as they now
               have the right to remain East until they choose to imigrate I do not percieve how
               setting apart for them removal and subsistence allowence to which they are entitled
               under the treaty will occasion them to be unsettled and unfixed. It is to be presumed
               as their prejudices against the country designs for them and which they also have
               contributed to purchase are removed by means of information they may receive from
               their friends who have imigrated that they will then desire to join their brethern
               and the means being furnished they will go leaving none behind only such as are still
               determined to remain East who until they change that opinion regard their situation
               as permanent it being dependent on their own choice. and their improvements on the
               lands they have purchased will be as progressive as if no means were furnished then
               to imigrate. What is there to make them more unsettled than the white citizens they
               too have a right to remove &amp; are offered a bounty to go to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">Texes</unclear>
            </p>
            <pb n="131" facs="0012_000590_000204_0131.jpg" xml:id="d3e4245"/>
            <p>but it is surely presumable that such as do not intend going are unsettled in
               consequence of having the offer made to them the liberty of changing our situation
               whenever we desire to do so is the prime cause of our being contented therewith.</p>
            <p>If the information concerning the Cherokees west be true instead of thier improving
               they are retrograding, and it is highly probable the gradual imigration of those East
               can alone prevent them from sinking into the same degraded situation as their
               neighboring tribes. While those remaining being at peace with each other under the
               influence of temperance and <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">religious
                  sometimes</unclear> will it is to be presumed continue to improve. And at this
               time they are capable of manufacturing their own clothing cultivating a suffiency of
               the earth for their support acquainted to a considerable extent with the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">mechanic</unclear> arts and a majority of them are
               capable of reading and writing either in their own language or the english. It is
               scarcely presumable that the Cherokees west will at any subsequent period become so
               blind to their own interest as to regard such immigrants as strangers. On the
               contrary so long as they on their arrival west can give the name of the clan to which
               they belonged they will be received and treated by all the members of that clan as
               brothers welcomed into their houses and assisted to make such improvements as they
               need. none will doubt this who are acquainted with Cherokee <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">ways</unclear> and customs</p> <pb n="132" facs="0012_000590_000204_0132.jpg" xml:id="d3e4264"/>
            <p>The Cherokees as well as most of the Indian tribes have no reason to fear of becoming
               too numerous not is it probable they will subject to any of their people coming in to
               enjoy their nights on that account. But the great danger to be apprehended by them is
               that of becoming extended which has already befallen so many the the once numerous
               tribes.</p>

            <p>your favor enclosing a letter from the Cherrokees was recieved on the 6 th inst and
               pleased to hear things have gone so well in my absence. also am informed by Mr Fisher
               that Mr Bryson has examined the ginsang taken in by you and pronounced it of an
               excellent quality. your attention thereto upon which you have been so sucessful is
               duly appreciated hope on my return to find that in all other branches of business
               intrusted to you that you display the same capacity and attention of so I shall no
               doubt conclude my absence has had a good effect as it afforded you an opportunity of
               showing what you could do if Mr Fisher sends you any goods price them agreeable to
               your previous instructions on that subject</p>
            <p>Purchase what corn you can delivered at the following places, Andrew Welches, John
               Gibbs, mothers and the store inform uncle and Mr gibbs I will pay them for receiving
               &amp;c if they should be unwilling to attend to it try to get persons in the same
               neighborhood who will. In the price make your purchases as low as customs justifies.
               and pay in doubtful debts which have been long due trade debts <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">contracted</unclear> this year and goods which are
               regarded as trade articles If any of the the teams are at home they can be employed
               hauling it in. I presume by taking corn it will enable some people to make payment
               who owning to the scarcity of money it would distress to pay anything else. Pay
               Benjam Parks the amount of his pension which he authorized me to receive and which I
               have collected $26.66 say to him I have written on to the agent in Savanna geo and
               made an arrangement</p>

            <p>which will enable me to receive the balance before I leave and that I will make an
               arrangement for him which will prevent his having much trouble respecting it in
               future. as the commissioner of pensions has furnished me with all the necessary
               blanks &amp;c give my respects to Mr Parks and say to him I would have directed the
               payment of what was due him sooner had I not been in the continued expection of
               returning home</p>
            <p>The Commissioner of I A yet has the claims under consideration of which I informed
               you it is presumable he will get through shortly until then I will be compelled to
               remain here not withstanding my desire to return. Say to the Cherokee chiefs such as
               you may see that unless I start home shortly I will write them all things in relation
               to their business</p>

               nothing can be done respecting it until after the commissioner of Indian Affairs

               has for some time past been undergoing a minute investigation. But from the near
               approach of Congress it is presumable he will complete it in a short time</p>

            <p>some difficulties having taken place with the Cherokees west in consequence of the
               murder of the Ridges and Boudinott the books and funds to pay them will not be sent
               as soon as anticipated and in all probability not until those difficulties are
               settled by the surrender and punishment of the murderers</p>
            <p>In the meantime it will be necessary for those persons holding claims on the
               Cherokees for which Judgment was rendered by the commissioners to apply to the
               Department for so much of the per capita as may be necessary to satisfy them to be
               appropriated to that purpose and deducted from the amount to be sent west whether
               that will be considered authorised by the treaty will I presume be the only question
               to decide</p>
            <p>Immediately after the commissioner completes his report and it receives the action of
               the secretary of war I design leaving for home make my arrangements there and return

               I will call and see you when probably I can be able to inform you more fully
               concerning Cherokee business in general. I have no acquaintance with Mr <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Harden</unclear> to whom you refer. I received a
               letter from gov Lumpkin sometime since and think it probable I shall see him here

            <p>Sir. I perceive in a communication of yours to the commissioner of Indian Affairs
               under date of March 3d 1837 you make the following mention of me and of my general
               character to which the object of this communication is to call your attention
               &quot;It is possible Mr Thomas may have furnished three dollars to each individual as
               stated in his account but no one believes it who is acquainted with him or his
               conduct in relation to the Indians he claims to have charge of&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;I will however ascertain as it is my intention to visit that section of country
               in the course of the spring when if he is justly entitled to his account I will
               apprize you accordingly&quot; It seems that the Department has not since been
               informed in relation thereto will you therefore do me the favor to inform me if on
               your visit to North Carolina you received any information to cause you to change your
               opinion if not <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">will you converse</unclear> with
               me on the subject and examine my evidence in relation thereto and do my injured
               character such justice as you shall be convinced is right. I am willing to make
               allowances for your being a stranger to me in consequence of which that you will

               admitted</p>

            <p>compliance will confer a lasting favor on an american citizen who has never injured
               you nor desired to do anything more than his character (worth more than life
               demanded). That you may see that at least I have some pretensions to respectability

            <p>Murphy (Extract) Nov 20, 1839</p>
            <p>your favor of the 4th inst was received on yesterday. In relation to collecting debts
               due at that place it has never been my intention to suspend on such as you deemed of
               a doubtful class where debts were certain as money was scarce and hard to raise I
               deemed it expidient to indulge such customers as long as I could and yet am of
               opinion it would be advisable to indulge them until until I come home as I have
               private settlements to make that could not be made before But I concur with you in
               opinion the pay wheel must be kept moving. Owing to the scarcity of money I deem it
               advisable to restrict the sales to such customers as are known to be intirely solvent
               when times are hard and collections have to be forced by law it is better to have the
               goods than debts which have to be collected in that way. however as to the Indian
               customers you can extend the same credit to them as heretofore and in such cases as
               you may think their circumstances justify it a little further I presume that many of
               them are in need of articles of clothing which it would not be advisable to withold
               on account of their being unable to pay down for them I have always credited them and
               have been paid whenever they had anything to pay</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="0012_000590_000204_0141.jpg" xml:id="d3e4496"/>
            <p>As to the debt on Martin Ange I think I left it at Qualla Town have directed that it
               be forwarded to you when recd proceed in such manner to secure it as you think
               proper. The curtailment of expenses to your board is approved of you seem still to
               have a desire of visiting the west with a view of settling there should you on my
               return continue of that opinion I will endeavor to make the necessary arrangements
               for you to do so The probability is by next spring I could obtain for you a situation
               that would pay all expenses in going to see that country and then if you did not like
               it you could return in determining on that point you should wawy matters and things
               and study your present and future interest As to the ginsange I presume you have
               received my letter on that subject if not sent it will be unnecessary to send it</p>
            <p>The commissioner of Indian Affairs has not completed his decisions he designs
               finishing next week I design leaving the charge of some of my unfished busines with
               some members of Congress and returning home to complete my private business and to
               make out some claims which have not been made out. Tell Mr Cuningham I have collected
               a part of his money and hope to collect the ballance In relation to the debts in
               Augusta pay them as fast you can I have written to those men on the subject give my
               respects to enquiring friends yours &amp;c W. H. Thomas</p>

            <p>Qualla Town,</p>
            <p>Have been informed by Mr Fisher that H P. King accompanied the waggons to Augusta and
               that you are keeping the store. In relation to which I have only to remark be careful
               and attentive and I presume I shall be able to give you business on my return for
               some time to come. As crops are bad and money scarce restrict credit to such
               customers respecting whose solvency no doubts can be entertained</p>

            <p>I have come to the conclusion that I had rather have the goods than any debts which
               have to be collected by law. Examine in my private papers for a note of two or three
               hundred dollars on Marin Angel which if found enclose to J W King at Murphy. I am
               still waiting for the commissioner of I A to make his decisions he expects to get
               through next week I shall return immediately after that business is finished I

               consquence of your statement of the scarcity of money and bad crops that have been
               made I am of opinion it will be advisable to curtail credit to such customers alone
               as you know to be solvent without running the least risk in crediting them it is
               better tot have the goods on hand than debts on persons unable to pay and who have to
               be sued under existing circumstances it will be advisable to lessen the amount of
               debts until times get better. your smith shop seems to be doing well. The

            <p>Dear Sir,</p>
            <p>your favor of the 18th was duly received have delayed an answer in hopes to attain
               the information required in relation to the ginsang. By a letter just recieved from
               home I ascertain my waggons started with the sang on the 12th inst but the quantity
               is not stated I expect to be informed by Jarrett who is requested to inform you of
               the amount am daily expecting a little on the subject.</p>
            <p>When I came here from Philadelphia last spring I ascertained that unless I made out
               the claim of the Cherokees remaining East before the Cherokee books were sent west
               that for want of its being <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">done</unclear> it
               was probable a large amount of what was due then would be lost I therefore being the
               attorney or agent 1046 in number whose powers of attorney I had previously filed
               deemed it expedient to entrust my mercantile business at home as well as the
               collection of ginsang to my partners at home who considered as capable of managing
               that business as I was the making out those claims kept me closely confined (the
               aggregate number was about <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">3000</unclear>) The
               department has decided in favor of about $150000, and rejected a claim for
               commutation of removal and subsistence allowance amounting to $55,000, On which I
               afterward obtained a reconsideration and permission to fill additional evidence and
               an argument in support of it, also included a claim therein which had been rejected
               in 1838, for preemption rights as the argument contained an amount of the rights of
               Cherokees under the treaties made with the US since a decision of the nation took
               place presumed it might afford you some</p>

            <p>amusement to read it have enclosed you one.</p>
            <p>The commissioner of Indian affairs has both these claims under consideration and I
               think it probable he will make his decision therein as well as complete his report on
               the Cherokee business acted on by the Board of Comissioners under the treaty of 1835
               last of next week but it may take him some longer until that business is completed
               its importance will compel me to remain here.</p>

               I have attained decisions in their favor to the amount of about $55000 on which I

            <p>Sir I have been here since last spring as attorney in part to settle the business of
               the Cherokees remaining East of the Mississippi arrising under the treaty of 1835 I
               expect to remain here but a short time and then to return home when all due from the

            <p>The commissioner has not completed his decisions will probably get through in a few
               days presume he will next week. am still of opinion the decisions of the board of
               commissioners will be confirmed and and the rejected claims we will have to go to
               congress for, but it will be expedient to obtain payment on the claims allowed before
               that application is made.</p>
            <p>In consequence of the existing difficulties with the western Cherokees growing out of
               the murder of the Ridges and Boudinott the department has issued an order to the
               agents west suspending the payment of all <unclear reason="illegible" resp="IH">monies</unclear> due from the united States until those difficulties are settled
               on which I applied for a separation of these East from those west and for payment to
               be made them without further delay that subject is under consideration and I am in
               hopes Hell receive a favorable decision. Having a power of attorney from Betsy
               Woodland to settle her business and having understood that she had never been paid
               removal and subsistence allowance entered her on the list of Cherokees remaining East
               which I had exhibited to the Department, but Betsy went to see the commissioner and
               informed him she was an Arkansaw Cherokee and came on to get her money. So thereby
               you will perceive that she can not be paid unless I can still get the commissioner to

            <p>your favor of the 14th was received this morning. In &quot; relation to the two
               entries which had been sold for the taxes I am unwilling to pay anything more than I
               informed you previously. I think that sum sufficient to compensate the purchaser for
               his trouble and I presume it will be found like most sales for taxes illegal. In that
               event the tender of his money as required by law was all that I deem necessary to be

               the board of commissioners which he expects to complete some time next week at
               furthest. I presume his decision will be as I have previously anticipated, that the
               divisions of the commissioners are dinal, in consequence of the existing difficulties
               with the Cherokees west, no payment will be made to them under the treaty until they

            <p>Dear Sir. I am yet here and the commissioner of Indian Affairs has not yet completed
               his decision he will probably get through next week. I am still of opinion the
               decisions made by the board of Commissioners will be confirmed and the rejected
               claims we will have to go to Congress for. But it will probably be advisable to
               obtain payment for the claims allowed before that approbation is made. In consequence
               of the existing difficulties with the Western Cherokees growing out of the murder of
               the Ridges &amp; Boudinott the department has come to the conclusion determination
               not to pay them any of their money due under the treaty of 1835 until those
               difficulties are settled. But as both delegations will be here in a short time it is
               probably they may effect a compromise which may be satisfactory unless they do it is
               not probably any payment will be made nor is it in my opinion advisable to bring the
               rejected claims before Congress. When the Commissioner completes his decisions I will
               inform you</p>

               unfinished. I am now indeed to believe it will be completed next week though it may
               require much longer. If it were finished I could not then leave until the arrival of
               governor Lumpkin having to attend to some business with him before I leave here.
               Sometime since I instructed my partner at home to pay all debts due from the stores
               as fast as collections could be made if any remains unpaid to you. I will allow you

            <p>Dear Sir, The commissioner of Indian Affairs has not completed his report on Cherokee
               claims but expects to next week at furthest. I presume I shall be as sucessful for
               the Cherokees as I anticipated-secured for them a sufficient sum when placed on
               interest to answer their purposes of Education &amp; and to remove such as may
               subsequently desire to join their brethren at their home west of the Mississippi
               leaving it optionary with themselves to go or stay. As I design making some payments
               to the state for land as I return will you please inform me what kind of funds will
               be received. I was enlisted to think the suspension of specie payments by the Bank
               had produced some change in that respect. I will inform you of the time I will be in

            <p>your favor of the 18th ultimo was not received until yesterday In relation to your
               interest in the Hollands field land I can say but little respecing it at present. I
               have for a long time been willing to purchase all the titles provided the aggregate
               cost thereof did not exceed the sum I considered the land worth to me and thereby put
               an end to the litigation which if I should make such purchase it would be to avoid
               the price you state for your interest would seem to be reasonable and I would be
               willing to give it provided I could purchase the other titles on terms above stated I
               calculate on reaching home in this month I can then ascertain more and inform you
               further on the subject should anything prevent my doing so I will inform you</p>
            <p>It will be unnecessary to send an argument in support of the cases refered to. The
               commissioner of Indian Affirs has completed his report and submitted it to the
               secretary of war who now has it under consideration and he informs me he will
               complete his action thereon</p>

            <p>until then but little can be said respecting it I presume however that we need have
               no fears as to the claims which were allowed by the board of commissioners and it may
               turn out that your lawyers who entrusted me with your business will have no reason to
               believe that I have neglected to attend to your rejected claims you will recollect
               that the board of commissioners refused to let the protests against their decisions
               be filed in those cases, since here I applied to the commissioner of Indian Affairs
               for that privilege to be given me which he granted and he has minutely examined all
               papers in those cases which has been the cause of the long delay</p>
            <p>As to the situation of the Cherokees remaining East I regret to hear bad feelings
               seem to exist with someof the whites respecting them. In my letteres to the Indians I
               have advised them to be at peace with each other and their white neighbors and as yet
               I have not been informed of those unfortunate people having given any just cause of
               offense. If my advocating their rights has offended any of my friends however much I
               might under any other circumstances regret it I have one consolation that I have
               faithfully discharged my duty to those people a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">censcuntion</unclear> discharge of which is worth more to me than the unjust
               approbation of the world and I had much rather be blamed for doing my duty than
               neglecting it and when entrusted with defending the rights of white or red man I hope

               accounts of the Indians will not be wound up, but permitted to run. To tell them that
               I dont want them to entertain any unkind feeling towards the whites for petitioning
               for their removal so long as they do nothing more than to petition the government to
               do what they have no power to do no attention should be paid to it. It is necessary
               that the Cherokees should act in such manner as to give no cause of complaint.</p>

            <p>your favor of the 1st inst was duly received. The secretary of war yet has the
               commissioners report under consideration I have no doubt is progressing with it fast
               as he can</p>
            <p>Whereas the Department has passed an order prohibiting the payment of the Cherokees
               of any of their dues under the treaty until their difficulties growing out of the
               death of the Ridges &amp;</p>

            <p>Boudinott are settled (this was done at the request of both parties of the
               Cherokees). I therefore presume it will be unnecessary for you to come here before
               those difficulties are settled</p>
            <p>As I have previously suggested to you I deem it inexpedient to lay any of the
               rejected claims before Congress until after those allowed are paid If we were to lay
               them before Congress before payment is made on such as have been allowed a commite
               might be appointed to investigate all the Cherokee business which in all probability
               would occasion a further delay of at least 2 years</p>
            <p>It is now too late for you to be of advantage here in settling the rules and
               construction of the treaty the secretary of war will have completed that before you
               could get here</p>
            <p>As I have before stated to you we must not loose sight of the rejected claims I have
               and will do all I can to have established principles which will lead to their being
               allowed when the proper time arrives. If once decided that the life estate reservees
               could only dispose of their own interest in reservations and that they could do no
               act to the prejudice of their children&apos;s rights to the fee simple title It would
               follow of course that all such claims would follow of course that all such claims
               would constitute just claims against the us. and if the claimants are not compensated
               therefor under the treaty of 1835 Congress no doubt will on a statement to that
               effect from the commissioner of Indian Affairs make an additional appropriation to
               satisfy such claims but what I have said in relation to our Indian business is
               intended for your information only as it might be considered improper in me to even
               state this much under existing circumstances</p>

            <p>your favor of the 15th was received this morning I presume the delay of my collection
               of ginsange has been occasioned by neglect in the agent at Hamburg or Charleston as I
               have been informed by a letter from home that it was sent on near the time Mr Jarrett
               sent his. I have this day written to both those agents respecting it and presume the
               ginsang will be sent you in a few days</p>
            <p>The secretary of war is progressing with my Cherokee business as fast as he can
               calculate to complete it in a few days but it may yet require two weeks. I have no
               doubt the Department is disposed to do justice the only difficulty is occasioned by
               some ambiguity in the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">causing of the</unclear>
               treaty but eventually I have no fears of succeeding as well for the Cherokees as I

               design returning home and if I can do so will make Charleston in my way to settle my

               remittance by mail immediately after receiving my money (which will not be until the

               be to deposit on interest for the Indians I have had offers therefore which I presume

               whose claims I have filed are concerned but it is probable he will be able to
               accomplish his purpose with the balance as I hear he has got a majority of of the
               Cherokees to sanction such a course. The secretary of war has not yet completed his

            <p>Dear sir</p>
            <p>your communication of the 8th inst was duly recd I delayed an answer thereto for the
               purpose of informing you the the particulars of the commissioners report which he
               completed and submitted to the secretary of war about the first of this month who has
               since had it under consideration and informs me he calculates getting through his
               action thereon in a few days but it may require longer thatn he anticipates until his
               action is completed but little can be known or said respecting it I presume however
               we need not fear loosing any claims which were allowed by the board of commissioners
               and it may be possible that principles may be settled which may enable us to gain
               many of the claims they rejected but I mention this for your information only as it
               might be thought improper in me to make such suggestion at this time I shall remain
               until the secretary completes his action. Immediately thereafter I design returning
               home, should anything occur to prevent my doing so will inform you. In the meantime
               should the rejected claims in part hereafter be gained I do not calculate that
               attention to them will require you to remain in NC unless it is your interest in
               other respects to do so the testimony filed will in all probability be all that will
               be admissible and the action</p>

               I have gained their per capita and other claims removal &amp; subsistence and pay for
               reemptions excepted which are now under consideration. The principal part of what
               will be due them I presume will be placed on interest for their benefit. It is
               probable no payments may be made under the treaty until the difficulties with the
               Cherokees growing out of the assination of the Ridges &amp; Boudinott are settled
               respecting which information is expected at the Department from the officers charged

            <p>Dear sir your communication of the 2d inst was duly received &amp; a reply thereto
               has been delayed for the purpose of being able to give you a satisfactory answer
               which I regret to state even now I am unable to do as fully as I could wish The
               commissioner of Indian Affairs did not complete his report on CHerokee claims until
               about the first of this month since which time the secretary of war has had it under
               consideration, and informs me he calculates to complete it in a few days but in that
               he may be mistaken as much depends on the quantity of Executive business which may
               come before him requiring immediate action until he completes his action on the
               commissioners report I will be unable to ascertain what desposition will be made of
               most of the money due the Cherokees East and on which some time past I obtained a
               decision whether or not it will be deposited on interest or left to the individuals
               to have loaned to individuals upon bonds with such sureties as might be considered
               sufficient to ensure the payment at the time promised. If the later course should be
               adopted it would afford me a pleasure to accommodate on the terms of which I informed
               you under existing circumstances I would advise the doing all you can</p>

            <p>Dear sir In your communication of the 11th of Oct you uinformed me you would be here
               as soon as you got funds for which you were then waiting. As I expect to have to
               remain here until until sometime in next month will you on the receipt of this letter
               please inform me when you will be here. should I get through my business a few before

            <p>commissioners report was completed the 1st of this month since then the secretary has
               it under consideration calculates to complete his action in a few days it may require
               longer than he now anticipates until he gets through but little can be known or said
               respecting it. I presume however there is no danger of the claims which have been
               allowed and it is possible that principles may be settled which may hereafter enable
               us to gain some which were rejected by them. But I dont calculate anything can be
               done with that class of claims after the secretary completes his action until
               sometime next spring. I therefore calculate on starting home unless something occurs
               more than I know of at present immediately after the secretarys action and make the
               necessary arrangements to return here so soon as I shall be informed by my friends
               that it is necessary. I am in favor of our persevering and not giving up any claim
               until every ground it can be placed on has been tried. Jno Ross and his chiefs
               shortly after the murder of the Ridges and Boudinott wrote to the commissioner of I A
               requesting him to make no payments under the treaty until their difficulties among
               themselves were settled a similar request has also been made by the other party the
               Department has made out an order suspending payment until the Cherokees with requests
               made of them. How soon they will comply if ever is at present uncertain. William
               &amp; Johnson Rogers &amp; S Waties &amp; J A Bell are here and Ross and his
               Delegation are expected here in a few days they may agree on some terms but I
               scarcely think it probable It is ascertained here that Ross has procured the consent
               of a majority of the Cherokee people to have all the per capita placed into the hands
               of the treasurer of the nation in this is possible he may succeed so far as those who
               have given their consent are concerned but in this I think I shall disappoint him as
               relates to the claims of those I have filed and procured a decision thereon by the C
               S A in their favor. Though he may give me some trouble as I understand his intention
               is to make a new treaty to answer his</p>

            <p>purpose and to have that of 1835 declared void. The secretary of war President &amp;
               prominent members of the sentate are opposed to doing anything further to accommodate
               him and unless he can in some way effect a change in their opinion I am at a loss to
               perceive how he will effect anything. The House of Representatives has not yet
               organised. If you calculate on bringing your Quarter M claims before Congress Ill
               file it as soon as I presume you need come on to attend to it.</p>
            <p>I think it probable a census will have to be taken of the Cherokees East whose claims
               are included and whose names I have exhibited on the list made out and filed to
               represent those who were included in the census of 1835 refered to in the 15th art of
               the treaty</p>
            <p>I some time since brought the question before the Secretary of War in the event of
               its becoming necessary I had concluded you &amp; Timson as well qualified as any
               others and intended trying to have the work progressing after the secretarys decision
               We have succeeded in getting gen Smiths accounts passed until but a small amount
               remains which I have no doubt an explanation from him would pass. The amounts he paid
               which it is believed are unauthorised by the treaty are suspended until the secretary
               fully decides thereon. For some time to come you had better with hold your wrath
                  <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">unegarand set against the Derter</unclear>
               lest in attempting to expose his faults you should injure your old friend who is
               responsible for his acts. I have delayed writing to you for some time therefore write
               the more lengthier letter now which is not intended to be made public as it might be
               considered improper in me to communicate even thish much at present give my respects

            <p>Jno Timson &amp; friends</p>
            <p>The commissioner of I A. completed his report about the 1st of this month and
               submitted it to the secretary of war who since that time has had it under
               consideration until his action is completed but little can be known or said
               respecting it I presume no fears need be entertained as to the claims which have been
               allowed and it is probable some principles may be settled favorable to some of the
               claims which have been rejected shortly after the assassination of the Ridges and
               Boudinott Ross and his party as well as those representing the other party of
               Cherokees requested the commissioner of Indian Affairs to suspend payments under the
               treaty until their difficulties among themselves were settled. The Department has
               made an order in compliance with their request Ross and his Delegation ar eexpected
               here in a few days a part of the other is now here and it is possible they may make
               some arrangements among themselves which will be satisfactory. It is also understood
               that Ross has got a majority of the Cherokees to consent that the per capita shall be
               paid over to the treasurer of the nation. This it is said he designs to accomplish by
               making a new treaty containing a provision suitable to his purpose and by getting
               annulled the treaty of 1835. I have no fears of his being able to effect the interest
               of the Cherokees East so far as their powers of attorney have been filed and on which
               some time since I obtained a favorable decision by the commissioner of Indian
               Affairs. But it is possible he will attempt to have what is due them paid into the
               hands of the treasurer as well as what is due those west I do not think you need</p>

            <p>give yourselves any uneasiness on account of the course he is about to pursue. you
               will recollect that I informed you before I came on that I presumed such a course
               would be pursued by Mr Ross therefore <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">bulieving
                  that such</unclear> would take place I have made any evry preparation for it that
               I conceived to be necessary. Though if any of your people East have not sent on their
               powers of atto it is important that such should be attended to immediately for we
               cannot reasonably expect the Department to deduct from the funds to be sent west more
               than is due the Cherokees East agreeable to their own <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">shewing</unclear> by their names and powers of atto filed In case any
               are sent on by mail mark on the outside power of atto and if I am not here will get a
               clerk in the war office and enter the names on the list I made out. Immediately after
               the secretary of war (J R P) completes his action on the commissioners report unless
               something occurs more than I know of at present I shall return home arrange my
               business and return here when my friends shall inform me it is necessary I am
               informed some of the white citizens have petitioned for the removal of the Cherokees
               East for which you should entertain no unkind feelings toward them but treat them
               with the same friendship as if they had not signed the petition. By acting in such a
               manner as to give no cause of complaint you recd have nothing to fear. That Being who
               rules the destinies of nations the friend of the oppressed and distressed of every

               for your consideration his claim for property which the removal of the Cherokees

            <p>Sir. As atto in fact of Jno Welch a Cherokee allow me herewith to submit his claim
               for property amounting to $621.00 of which he was deprived by citizens of the US
               previous to the conclusion of the treaty of 1835 and for which payment was provided
               by the 3d article of the supplement to said treaty claimant alledges he was prevented
               from filing his claim before the Cherokee Committee and commissioners acting under
               the treaty by Ross and others opposed to it that they induced him to believe first
               that it would not be enforced and afterwards that longer time would be given the
               Cherokees to remain in the country and to settle their business. In the year 1838 he
               became convinced neither of these objects could be accomplished and proceeded to Fort
               Cass Ten to present his claims to the committee then in session at that place on his
               arrival there at the instance of Ross as he believes he was thrown into prison and
               kept there until the committee had <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">ceased</unclear> their business and was thereby prevented from h having his
               claims acted on</p>

            <p>Dec 28, 1839</p>
            <p>Sir the secretary of war has completed his action on the com report which I was
               permitted to see on yesterday but I presume it will not be made public until after it
               is copied which will probable require eight or ten days</p>
            <p>The Department has decided that the decisions made by the Board of Commissioners on
               claims which were provided for by the treaty are final and that all the claims which
               were allowed by them were provided for except the following.</p>
            <p>1st William Barns claim no 10</p>
            <p>2d Bold Hunters do no 7</p>
            <p>Both these claimants had been compelled to purchase their reservations for the sum of
               $800 each which sum with the interest thereon was allowed them by the commissioners.
               By settling their reservations previous to the conclusion of the treaty it is decided
               that they forfeited their rights to compensation the decisions of the commissioners
               in those cases are therefore decided unauthorised and void.</p>
            <p>3d Charles Thompson No 66</p>
            <p>4th Sutten Stephens no 91</p>
            <p>For whose claims the commissioners decided grants should issue the Department has
               decided by the 1st art of the supplement these claims are relinquished and by the 3d
               article compensation is <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">provided</unclear> to
               be in lieu of titles thereto that no grants can issue to the claimants but when
               ascertained they are entitled to receive the value thereof. It is also decided that
               the last appropriation made for the Cherokees is applicable to the purpose of paying
               for reservations which have been allowed. I am still of opinion it is impracticable
               to apply to Congress for payment of the rejected</p>

               those allowed. But I cannot conceive how the Department after having reviewed the
               decisions refered o can prevent our obtaining an investigation of all the rejected
               claims</p>

               28th ulitmo and the following added thereto that Ross had arrived here with his
               Delegation it is said for the purpose of etting the government to annul the treaty of
               1835 so far as the nation is concerned and to make a new one containing such
               provisions as they desire and he has notified the the Department that Louis Ross is
               elected treasurer of the nation and authorised to receive all the money due the
               Cherokees the light in which he received by the government I presume you have seen in
               the secretary of wars report (murderer) It will probably turn out that it was
               fortunate for the Eastern Cherokees that their claims were made out and submitted to
               the Department in time. The completing of this business so far as respects decisions
               on their claims are <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">cumed</unclear> I hope will

            <p>Sir. your favor of the 16th ultimo was not received until a few days since In
               relation to the tract of land refered to since I saw you I have been so much engaged
               that I have not had the opportunity of examining it am therefore unable to inform you
               the price I would be willing to take for it. My business here is nearly at a close
               immediately thereafter I design returning home and will as soon as I have the
               opportunity examin the land and inform you what sum I will be willing to take for it
               and will make no sale to any other person until I see or hear from you yours

            <p>Murphy Cherokee NC. The secretary has completed his action on the commissioners
               report the decisions made by the Board of commissioners on claims provided for by the
               treaty are final with four exceptions all the claims allowed by them were provided
               for your claims were among those confirmed The claims for per capita, improvements,
               spoliations, property sold, are also confirmed. The preemption claims having been
               rejected by the Atto gen in 1838 are separate evidence I have been trying to get it
               again refered to him for reconsideration. The removal &amp; subsistence claim it is
               decided the Cherokees East are entitled to but it is believed they cannot receive it
               unless they remove within such time as the President may designate that it cannot be
               placed on interest but as the affixing the construction to the treaty belongs to the
               Atto gen I am making arrangements to get his opinion thereon by which I have no doubt
               the Department would be guied as there is a disposition manifested to do the
               Cherokees justice</p>
            <p>I asked the Department to separate the claims of the Cherokees East from those west
               and to make the proper entries on the Books but that subject could not come up until
               the above was decided it is now under consideration presume it will be decided in a
               few days</p>

            <p>I have reason to believe the decision will be as I have desired Ross and his
               Delegation have it is said procured the consent of a majority of the Cherokees to
               have the treaty of 1835 annuled and to make a new one containing a provision that the
               money due the Cherokees shall be paid to the treasurer of the nation and have
               notified the Department that Louis Ross is elected treasurer to acrue all monies due
               the Cherokees. I informed the com of I A that for the Cherokees East so far as their
               interest was concerned I should protest against any changes being made prejudicial to
               their interest Ross and his Delegation as yet have not been recd by the Department a
               few days since the secretary of war addressed a letter to them informing them that
               until Ross disproved the charges against him of his having been concerned in the
               murder of the Ridges and Boudinott &amp; of exciting the creeks and seminoles to
               hostilities against the Us no communication from him or having his name signed to it
               would receive the attention of the Department and until then he would be regarded as
               a murderer and enemy of the Us payment has been suspended by order of the Department
               under the treaty until the difficulties among the Cherokees are settled</p>

               relation to your solvency I stated when in Philadelphia as much all that I could now
               write in your favor. It might be advisable for you to get Capt Jarrett to write on to

               a purchase can be made on better terms. The commissioner of I A completed his report
               on Cherokee claims and submitted it to the secretary of War last of Nov his action
               thereon was not completed until a few days since. The result of which is that all the
               claims which had been allowed by the Board of Com and entrusted to me have been
               confirmed. But I have yet one claim of the Cherokees East amounting to about $55,000
               on which I have obtained a conditional decision in their favor The Atto gen&apos;s

               by restricting credit will bring produce which can be made to answer of purpose by
               giving for it what we can get deducting carriage. This course always should be
               adopted when money is scarce in the country. It was in anticipation of the scarcity
               of money that I have made the efforts I have to try to procure my private funds in
               order to aid my mercantile business (to some extent through the crisis If all at have
               done as much to prepare for it as I have and am still doing no fears need be

            <p>The money due the Cherokees will not be paid for some time yet the disturbances among

               should have started home but understand petitions are coming up from Macon for the
               removal of the Cherokees I will probably wait until they are laid before Congress to
               know what is desired I presume money has become scarce in the country that produce is
               plenty such as corn Baun &amp;c A market is wanted such as trooops sent in country
               would give then may be some other reasons of which I have not been informed the only

               without depriving them of their rights and unless the privilege of writ of habeas
               corpus be refused such object never can be accomplished My course which my situation
               will compell me to pursue will be to discharge my duties faithfully in discharge of
               which I shall endeavor to suppport Justice and oppos einjustice without enquiring
               whether the pary for or against whom I have to act be red or white. since the above

            <p>your favor of the 28th ultimo was delayed much longer than usual the time payment
               will be made to the Cherokees is uncertain. The secretary of war on the 8th nov
               suspended payment until their difficulties were settled. I asked a modification of
               the order which is not decided I presume it will be shortly Ross &amp; D are
               intending it is said to get the government to set aside the treaty of 1835 have one
               made providing that the money shall beb paid to the treasurer of the nation has mae
               no progress If he fails in that will then try to have $400000 spoliation paid under
               the treaty of 1835 but as they are for less is incured since the treaty I thnk he can
               be prevented from getting them paid that would save the Eastern Cherokees about
               $40000. The importance of my remaining is obvious the petition for the removal of the
               Cherokees are coming up which may produce some further <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JM">delay</unclear> but in my opinion can effect nothing else. I am still in
               favor of the Indians loaning their money when recd provided they receive more than is
               necessary for their own purposes. As yet is uncertain what change may be effected in
               the dispposition of the money. The government while acting on questions in which the
               Indians are intrusted claims the right of exercising a guardianship and control which
               may be deemed most to their interest</p>
            <p>The claims of Mr Morris are in the same situation as those of other Cherokees East I
               hope the time is not distant when I can return &amp; see my nation country &amp;

            <p>I think by perseverance I will be able to gain some of the rejected reservation
               claims payment is suspended under an order of the 8th nov by secretary of war the
               modification of which as relates to the Cherokees East is under consideration the per
               capita cannot be paid nor the amount ascertained until the Agent makes a return of
               the amount expended in subsisting the the last emigrants considerable time will then
               be required to make out the estimates Jno Ross has it is <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">industove</unclear> bought on about $400000 spoliation claims which I
               presume if he cannot get the treaty set aside he will try to have paid out of the per
               capita money that would take from the Eastern Cherokees about $40000 If he could get
               the treaty set aside then payment would be made to the Treasurer of the nation Louis
               Ross As yet he has not been recd by the Department I do not believe he can accomplish
               either object by attention I believe it is necessary for some person to be here to

            <p>your favor of the 8th and 19th was received an answer to the first was delayed in
               consequence of an action of the Department on a question then pending being necessary
               to enable me to give you the information required. On the 8th of nov the secretary of
               war issued an order prohibiting payment to the Cherokees I asked for a modification
               of that order to allow of payments to the Cherokees East which was decided favorable
               the per capita part of which I designed leaving cannot be paid until the returns are
               received from the agent west they are looked for daily. after they are received it
               will there require some time to make out the estimates by the accounting offices. I
               have been taught by experience to allow time enough for payment to be made by the
               government especially when there is a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">deficy</unclear> in the treasury a bill is before Congress to supply it by issue
               of treasury notes &quot;All I can say on the subject of leaving the money is I think
               your offer liberal as much so as any I have received &amp; I know of no firm it would
               offer me more pleasure to accommodate I will make no disposition of any of the money
               until I shall be in Charleston which will be immediately after</p>

               much pleasure to do on the 8th of Nov an order was issued by the secretary of war

               favorable a few days since claims stand ready for payment though the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">dificery</unclear> of money in the treasury may delay
