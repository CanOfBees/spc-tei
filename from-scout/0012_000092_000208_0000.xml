               <note type="abstract">1863 April 14 Southgate Cregmile in Murfreesboro, Tenn., to his brother Crittenden. Shares sad news of the death of a young man from their hometown, but others from there are doing well. Has just been paid but many lost their money to Rebels who captured and burned the train between there and Nashville. Confident that the camp is so fortified now that the entire Southern Confederacy could not take it. Troops go to the depot daily to check on arrival of provisions. Gen. John Basil Turchin is their brigade commander now. Urges him to write and often.</note>
