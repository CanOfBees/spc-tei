            <p>Sir,</p>
            <p>I had the honour to receive your letter of the 24th instant.  The Government of the United States has not in the least itnerefered, with the prceeds of the awards made at London under the 7th Article of the British Treaty, in favour of persons who had Agents on the spot.  But the British Government having paid to Mr. Erving, public Agent for the prosecution of claims, the awards made in favour of persons who had not appointed any agent at London to receive the amount; and a number of those awards having thus remained unclaimed in Mr. Erving&apos;s hands for a length of time, it was thought necessary as well for the security of the individuals concerned, as in order not to attach responsibility to Government, that the amount of those unclaimed awards should be drawn over to America and placed in the Bank of the United States, where they remain subject to the order of the parties.  But in every case where claimants had an agent in London and even</p>

            <p>in cases where Mr. Erving has received or may receive the amount of awards, by virtue of special powers given by such claimants, the instalments continue to be paid in London as heretofore to the Agents or special Attornies of the claimants.</p>
            <p>I have the honour to be,</p>
            <p>very respectfully</p>
            <p>Sir,</p>
            <p>Your oeb. servt</p>
            <p>Albert Gallatin</p>
            <p>Charles Pettit Esq.</p>
