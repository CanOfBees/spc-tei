               <note type="abstract">1865, June 3 David L. Jones in Nashville, Tenn., to his wife Anna M. Jones in Allegheny City, Pa. Familiarizes her with his well spent daily routine in the camp, in comparison to the other soldiers&apos; laziness and the resulting consequences. Complains that any attempt at establishing a routine is often interrupted by constant relocation. Mentions that the barracks is presently located near the former 1800 acre spread of Rebel General Cheatham and his three sons. He describes in detail the landscape, architecture, and not so obvious religious affiliation, which his regiment shares with hundreds of soldiers of no fewer than seven other regiments in the area. Having no idea when he&apos;ll return home, assures her of his faithfulness and reminds her not to be so lenient with the boys.</note>

            <p>we were at we had everything so convenient there i had made little stools and a Place to write on and a wash board we had to leave all behind for we could not carry them at the time and to go back the next day would be useless I recieved 2 letters from you one on the first and the other on the second they were dated the 28 &amp; 29 I was glad to learn that you and the children were all well as i am through Mercy I guess Mr <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Camel </unclear> is home by this time he can tell you how i Look and if i was when he was here I have not been on duty since last Monday i am <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Jubbin&apos;s</unclear> at the Barracks so i have had no time to go around here so as to give you an account of the country around here it stands of the Property of Rebel Genl Cheatham and his three Sons lived all in sight of each other they have a Splendid house apiece and owned 18 hundred acres of Splendid Land here all in one Batch they tell me that there was a Large Orchard here but our fellows cut them </p>
