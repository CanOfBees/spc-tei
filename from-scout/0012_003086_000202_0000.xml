            <p>Last night was a sleepless night at the N.C. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Dormtory</unclear> after I went to my room from the masked ball.
					It was <del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">best</del> the best ball of its sort
					I have ever seen. I danced only until twelve.</p>
            <p>This morning I came down on the train with <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Judge Clegg</unclear> and we talked over <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">otn</unclear> Indian <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Durnce</unclear> question He came by for <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">drinks</unclear>.

					afternoon I read two <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">wsdtes
						Fasty</unclear> mails and this evening had prayers at <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Air</unclear> church. No <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">natiirs can.</unclear>

               <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Mones</unclear> tells me he was up until
					five this morning. Some boys were in the cabin. I hope there was no gambling or
					drinking. I suppose they just talked. I believe <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Mones</unclear>. I trust him and beleive he is truthful. God be

            <p>This morning I worked on my books and got a good deal done. This afternoon I went
					down town and saw Mr Hagen. We found that the notice for the permit had 1921 on
					it so he phoned to Harry Watson and received permission for me to change it <del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">with</del> adding my initials.</p>
            <p>He is going with Moses up the river a ways some to see about a place where they
					are making liquor. I am glad he will have this chance to talk to Moses. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Tin</unclear> is a good man at heart.</p>
            <p>Dick Heame is going to haul some wood tomorrow and I am glad. We hear about 19
					cords cut now as I am going to take 10 from Dick at $9<emph>00</emph> per
					cord. Please God some money will come in soon.</p>
            <p>There was a dance at the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Missin</unclear>
					tonight and Moses went to the village afterwords. I am sorry we got <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">a</unclear> no studying. He <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">dors</unclear> nothin to study but neither do
					I. He can make it if he tries and I <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">tuhn</unclear> he will.</p>

            <p>We made the 18 mile house by 12:15 over a very heavy rough trail, and reached
					here at 6:30. The dogs were sick all morning from the fish they ate last night

            <p>The Bp&apos;s letter yesterday commended me on my work at Tanana and brought a

            <p>When one is touched with anothers sorrows, trials and temptations where one knows

            <p>Life is indeed a mystery, a tragedy and a dream. The deeper I go the more

            <p>God forgive my sins and lead me on to higher things for himself. May He who hung

            <p>This morning I did but little toward the betterment of my country. I have just

            <p>M<emph>r</emph> Crantz came in this evening and asked me to marry him &amp;
					Miss <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Fletcher</unclear>. I dread going up

            <p>M had class tonight and read. I with Moses <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">cond</unclear> enough to give more time to it. There is so much to be

            <p>This morning I pressed up my clothes in part and this afternoon slept after class
					with Moses. Last night I had a talk with Moses to which he responded more than

					service to him. I feel it because I am as eager to help him. He has remarkable

					want to help him with that I am not at all able to touch on under the present
					conditions and the time grows <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">I
						hurt</unclear> if he is to go out this summer. Surely it will not always be

               <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Guyes</unclear> residence. I was surprised

					offering of about four dollars was taken. It was a most helpful service I
					assisted in it though I did not have my <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">surplies</unclear> then. Mr Taylor from the Fairbanks Laundry came over.
					After service I dictated some letters. All together I have 2 <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">b</unclear> dictated. Moses is much on my heart

            <p>This morning I learned that Mr <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Drane</unclear> had given away some of the cabins after the owners died
					according to Chief Henry. This causes trouble if it be so.</p>
            <p>I have made arrangements to take out $3000 insurance for Moses to see him through
					school should I die. The Presby-terian <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">minsters fund</unclear> offer a most reasonable policy.</p>
            <p>Moses I am sorry to say is not showing much interest in his work and studies and
					it is most discouraging and disheartening. There are three or four things that
					worry and distress me very much. Please God I shall be able to correct them.</p>
            <p>M<emph>rs</emph>James Paul Sherman came up tonight and talked quite a
					while. She is going to have a child and is much worried after I am Priested she
					will probably make her confession. God bless and help her and carry <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">her safety</unclear> through. God bless and
					help those at home also. They are much on my heart and mind. I hope all is well
					with them.</p>

            <p>I am confronted with the question of my ordination in a way that I have never

            <p>I am much disappointed in Mr Thomas today. He does not express himself <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">fouly</unclear> but to my mind is
					intellectually dishonest. I offered the only possibility of training on being
					ordained. If Mr Thomas were willing to take my work here and give me time to
					study I could get upon it but he pretended not to see through it It is pretty
					hard lines when you have looked forward to a friend and found him an enemy. I am
					sorry.</p>
            <p>I have decided to wire the Bp. that I shall pospone my ordination. I cannot
					persuade myself to be ordained in the local ministry. It will be hard to wait
					but I suppose I must do it. It will be harder still to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">serve</unclear> under <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Drane</unclear> as a deacon. God have mercy on
					me. If it is because I have given the time to Moses I am glad to make the
					sacrifice I said I would make it and I will.</p>
            <p>God bless Moses and help him in his life. Those at home have been much on my
					heart and mind today. God be with them.</p>

            <p>This afternoon Moses changed in regard to his expression the other day about

            <p>I told Miss B. that I would not marry them if he were drunk when he came up. This

					and did not find him there. He was some where around town. Julia was also

					all packed up and ready to leave.</p>
            <p>Moses did not return and I became most anxious about him. Joe and I went after

            <p>This has been a very hard day. I ordered a coffin for Miss Farthing&apos;s body
					today. Unfortunately while we were lifting the body out one man slipped and the
					rope slipped. The body fell from the top of the grave. In this it was buried the
					strong way it fell on the head and the whole thing was ghastly and horrifying It
					makes me sick. The body was all in tact I helped lift it on to the sheet. I was
					not worthy to touch the feet of that saint but am thankful I had the
					privilege.</p>
            <p>This afternoon Miss W. Mr Hughes Moses. Charlie Albert The Bishop and I went
					over. The Bp. consecrated the grave yard and Miss Farthing&apos;s body was again
					laid to rest. God bless her soul in Paradise.</p>

            <p>The greatest event was Moses and John taking an airplane ride. It clost 7<emph>50</emph> for 15 minutes. Mose enjoyed it and woud like to have gone

            <p>We had luncheon with Miss Bedell and it was a pleasant in a measure but but

            <p>I do not seem to be accomplishing very much. God grant that <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">acuray</unclear> be well.</p>

            <p>This morning I made an effort to prepare my talk for the &quot;<unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Ossch</unclear> Circle&quot; I have never been
					as nervous over any thing in my life. There was not time to write out a talk so
					I tried to follow an outline In a way I was fairly successful but felt so badly
					that I gave them a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">pessamptic</unclear>
					idea of Alaska. I say frankly that Alaskas outlook for the future is not the
					bright flowery one that the polititions paint it. The Archdeacon says that he
					think Alaska will finally return to the native people to whom it belongs. That
					there will alway be gold there and always be white men there but not as it was
					in the early days.</p>
            <p>I went to see Kenneth about a dining room suit for Mother and Father for their 45
					wedding anniversary on Saturday but every thing is to high.</p>
            <p>God grant thy Blessings on Moses <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">and

            <p>St Augustine Fla.</p>
            <p>About 6:00 P.M. I arrived in this beautiful and quaint old city. It was a
					pleasure to recall all the things Kenneth Haus told me of it long years ago. Its
					narrow streets, its quaint old buildings and its wonderful hotels and this
					beautiful river &amp; bay make it most attractive.</p>
            <p>I called up Mr Day and he drove in to see me. He seemed interested in my work,
					but felt he could not do much. I may wait until the noon train tomorrow or I may
					leave early in the morning. It all depends on what connections I can make. I
					feel as long as I am here I <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">should</unclear> see Mr Hindry and see if he can create any interest and
					raise any money for me.</p>
            <p>God I pray thy Blessings on my efforts to accomplish these things for me. Grant
					that I may raise the $5000<emph>00</emph> and Moses tuition for thy sake
					Through Jesus Christ Our Lord.</p>
            <p>Amen.</p>

            <p>This is the last night I shall spend in Brooklyn. The <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">King</unclear> and <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Gus</unclear> have been most kind and hospitable. Sometimes I have felt

					no help for it. I have not had the money to stay elsewhere. At every opportunity
					I have tried to be away, but that has not been very often.</p>
            <p>This afternoon I went to the Capitol theatre with M<emph>rs</emph>Ferguson
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Onerine</unclear> Kozart. It was

            <p>This morning I came in to D<emph>r</emph>
               <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Onderdouloo</unclear> office and he
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">finished up</unclear> my teeth. Then I

               <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">cary</unclear> all 9<emph>00</emph>
					and a few other things I needed. I had to go out to Brooklyn again for the rest
					of my things. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Thro threw</unclear> me
					late. By the time I packed and got off it was 6:00 P.M. I phoned Celia and she
					came down with a package to see me off. I hated in a way to say good bye to N.Y.
					I like the old town somehow despite all the agonies I suffered there. I find
					Celia&apos;s package to be a beautiful brass candlestick and the candle also a
					pack of Pall Mall cigarettes from &quot;Joe.&quot; The last I shall smoke.</p>
            <p>I am glad to be done with operation. They have cost the poor &quot;Board&quot; a

            <p>When I arrived I went up to Bp. Griswalds office to find <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LW">Dr. Rendale</unclear> to secure my posses. I

            <p>It was very nice indeed to see &quot;Holly&quot; again. She is a very sweet girl

					boy is not going to be appointed and I am sorry for his sake. I do not honestly
					believe that the Board wants to place any one at Nenana It is willing <del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">work</del> to work its workers in Alaska to
					death and then send in a few more. I never card the like. I should not write
					this statement for surely they are doing the best they can. We simply must have

            <p>I am truly distressed that it is taking so very long but one thing after another

            <p>Last night was sleepless, but most happy. I spent it in thought and prayer to

            <p>This has been a busy day. I went out to D<emph>r</emph> McClaughlins for
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">dinna</unclear> and was interested to
					meet hi m and his family. They are a fine lot of little children and very
					bright. All <del type="overstrike" hand="rgt">day</del> afternoon I have been
					about seeing to some hardware for logging purposes. This morning Bp. and M<emph>rs</emph> Rowe came &amp; Paul. It was very fun to see our Dear
					Bishop I certainly love him.</p>
            <p>I am deeply grieved that I was not able to tell him that I had raised the
					$5000,00 I set out to raise It was more bitter dis-appointment in every way. The
					Bishop was very fine about it. He plans to come into the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Intern</unclear> in the Spring I hope he comes
					to Nenana I should like to take him to the Crossing.</p>
            <p>This noon I had luncheon with M<emph>rs</emph>
               <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Archinson</unclear> and her daughter
						<unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">irs Law</unclear> The Bp. told me to
					get a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">horse</unclear> if I needed it and
					let him know.</p>

            <p>I have been very busy day most of the morning I spent looking at a sawmill and

					for the mill a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">plamer</unclear> a cut off
					saw and a small hoist. I hope it will be possible to get them in time to get
					them set up before spring so I can do a good deal of work between seasons.</p>
            <p>This after noon I wanted <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">out</unclear> a
					luncheon from which I could not get away. However I learned something about the

            <p>God give me a steady mind and increase me in wi sdom and understanding through

            <p>Amen</p>

            <p>Bp. Cremont is on board and we sit at the table together. He is very well indeed.

            <p>The Bp. told me Jenkins is not <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">coming</unclear> in as he wants too much money. I am glad. It was

            <p>This has been a gray day save for an hour or so after breakfast when it was very

            <p>I had quite a long talk with Miss <unclear reason="illegible" resp="SS">Mcloneux</unclear> about the work. She is much in need and somewhat

            <p>It is very interesting and plant to visit these coast towns and see the work in

            <p>A large number of our crew have left us here a few go on to Cordova Valdez Seward
