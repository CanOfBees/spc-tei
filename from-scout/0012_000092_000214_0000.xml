               <note type="abstract">1864 January 7 Southgate Cregmile in Chattanooga, Tenn., to his brother Crittenden. Assures him that he and all the hometown boys are presently well kept and well fed. Received his gift of warm winter gloves, but the weather is so warm there now he may have to put off wearing them. Describes how, if he were on picket right now, would see hundreds of deserting Rebels, officers and enlisted men, pouring in since the Battle of Missionary Ridge. Predicts, if this keeps up, in ten months there will not be any men  left. Urges him to write soon and not to make it a short one just because his is.</note>
