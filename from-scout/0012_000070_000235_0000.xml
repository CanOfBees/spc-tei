               <note type="abstract">In this letter, dated December 12, 1861, C.A. Eames in Millwood, Tenn. writes to O.P. Temple in Knoxville, Tenn. about the case of John McMackin, for which Eames is to be a witness. He inquires whether he might send his &quot;contracts&quot; instead of coming in person as he fears that, &quot;being a Northern Man,&quot; he will be arrested.</note>

            <p>Mr John McMackin tells me that you are to assist him in his case &amp; desire me to appear as a Witness in his behalf I only wish to inquire if I send you my contracts between myself &amp; the parties I bot hoggs for if it will not do as well as for me to come in person as I am a man that they have had a great desire to arrist being a Northern Man &amp; I wish to conduct myself in such a ways as not to give them a cause to malest me at all as my presents in my Business at home call so Strong. McMackin was Buying hogs for me &amp; the Bonds I have will prove that the hogs was Bot for the Southern Government so I think McMackin clear of the charge made against him.</p>
