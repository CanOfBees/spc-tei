            <p>In accordance with the rules of our association.  The painful duty of communicating to you, the death of your husband {J. O. Freeman} devolves on us.  He fell in the late engagement with the enemy at <name type="place">Chickamauga</name>, whilst nobly defending the rights of his country, this to you is indeed a Sad calamity, for which we deeply Sympathize with you.  We are happy to inform you that he professed religion during the late revival of religion near <name type="place">Chattanooga</name> and since that time his deportment has been such as always characterises a true christian.  We feel Satisfied that our loss is his eternal gain, for "Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord".</p>
