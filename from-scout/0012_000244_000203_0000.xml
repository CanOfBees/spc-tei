            <p>AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY</p>
            <p>by</p>
            <p>EDWIN HANSFORD RENNOLDS SR.</p>
            <p>Commenced October 31st, 1896</p>
            <p>Introduction</p>
            <p>I have long entertained the idea that I ought to write something of my life for
                    the perusal of my posterity, and having today entered on my fifty-eighth year, I
                    am impressed with the notion that it is time it was begun, as no one knoweth
                    when his life here on earth will be closed.</p>
            <p>I write this, not because I flatter myself that there is much in my life to be
                    proud of, or worthy to be held up for the emulation of others, but because I
                    feel that perhaps I may be justified in saying that &quot;where little is
                    given, little is required,&quot; and because that any life faithfully written,
                    affords examples of failures that may be beneficial in warning others of the
                    pitfalls that beset us in this world, even though it may not contain noble deeds
                    to stimulate others.</p>
            <p>My life has in some respects been eventful, and may thus afford something to
                    interest as well as instruct. No one could go through four years of war without
                    having seen many things that would admit of reproduction with pen and ink. The
                    latter half of the l9th century has certainly been productive of events, as
                    stirring as any in the world&apos;s history, excepting of course the years that
                    ushered in the Christian Era.</p>
            <p>I desire also that my children should have something more than mere tradition to
                    tell them of their ancestry. And it is my greatest regret that I cannot trace
                    back farther into the past our lineage.</p>
            <p>I commit my effort to those who read its pages, with the hope that it will be in
                    some way or ways beneficial to those for whom it is written, or any others who
                    may be tempted to read any or all of it, and I invoke the aid of Him whom &quot;they labor in vain that build the house.&quot;</p>

            <p>Chapter 1</p>
            <p>The Rennolds Family</p>
            <p>I can trace our ancestry back no farther than about the beginning of the 18th
                    century when two brothers (John and Robert) emigrated from the vicinity of
                    London, England, and settled in Virginia, near the town of Tappahahnock, on the
                    Rappahannock River. Our branch of the family descended from the latter.</p>
            <p>My Grandfather, Reuben Rennolds, settled about the year 1800, 1 1/2 miles N. W.
                    of what is now Frederick&apos;s Hall Depot, in Louisa Co. Va, he had but
                    recently married Miss Elizabeth Hay Taliaferro, where he resided till his death,
                    in the autumn of 1856 (I think). He was of large frame, of rather indolent
                    habits, strong prejudices but honorable and upright. He was a Methodist
                    exhorter, In his old age he became totally blind, and was compelled to commit
                    his business to his son William.</p>
            <p>His wife, (Miss Elaizabeth Hay Taliaferro) was intelligent, with some education,
                    and it is from her that the family inherited some of their most valuable
                    characteristics. Teaching a private school in the family residence, she was able
                    to add some to the income of the family, and also to give her children the
                    rudiments of an education. The ownership of a few slaves by her husband helped
                    to obviate the necessity of drudgery, to obviate the evils of my
                    grandfather&apos;s indolence, and to insure some of the comforts of life. I do
                    not know the date of my grandmother&apos;s death.</p>
            <p>Eight children were born in the fami1y, all of whom reached manhood and
                    womanhood; vig: Taliaferro, Battaile, John Stockdale, Robert, William, Richard
                    and Mary (twins) and Sarah Ann.</p>
            <p>Taliaferro studied medicine, and after graduation located in Staunton, Va., where
                    he built up a fine practice, and accumulated some wealth. He never married, and
                    died in February 1864. I visited him during his last illness, and was impressed
                    with the evi- dence of the strong hold he had on the affections of the people of
                    Staunton. He was of strong build, vigorous manhood, and indomitable energy. Was
                    not religious but rather skeptical in some respects. His ambition was to erect a
                    model Flour mill and put much or most of his means into and effort to build one
                    in Augusta Co., Va. Much of his property went to waste because it was sold for
                    Confederate money, and his administrator (his brother William) through bad
                    management, pretty effectually scattered it all.</p>
            <p>Battaile was the largest in body. He to accumulated property as a mechanio and
                    farmer, but failed I fear to lay up treasures in Heaven. He married, lived
                    awhile at Tuscumbia, Ala., then in Caddo Parrish, La., and finally settled in
                    Grimes Co., Texas. He had two sons, Wm. Battaile and John. The former was a
                    lawyer and editor in Anderson, Texas. Both lost their lives in the Confederate
                    Army. His daughters six or more in number married and settled in Grimes Co.,
                    five of whom lost their husbands by the war. I heard Uncle B. say (perhaps in
                    1866 or 7) that he had six women and their children dependent on him to look
                    after their affairs. One was widow of his son (Wm. B&apos;s) wife. He died
                    sometime in the seventies.</p>
            <p>John Stockdale was a physician and perhaps had the best mind of any of them. He
                    was a successful business man and successful practitioner. He made his home at
                    his father&apos;s till his death in Sept. or Oct. 1847. He had two farms,
                    several negroes and other property. His father inheriting more from him than he
                    owned him-</p>

            <p> self at the time. He was a member of the Elk Creek Baptist Church, had
                    impressions to preach, which he much regretted having failed to heed. Yet he did
                    not withstand temptation. He died unmarried. Special reference to my father
                    (Robert) will be reserved for another chapter.</p>
            <p>William was a teacher and surveyor. He did not marry till about 1855. His wife
                    was Miss Barbara Duke from the lower part of Louisa Co. He had charge of his
                    father&apos;s business from 1841 till his father&apos;s death, and was his
                    executor. He visited my father in the summer of 1847, remaining till called back
                    by his brother John&apos;s death. I remember the visit well though only 8 years
                    old. He was a Baptist and a pious man. He was not as successful as a business
                    man. He died about 1875. Left 3 or 4 children. The two eldest were William and
                    Richard. The third was a daughter, born while I was there on a visit in Feb.
                    1864. Lieut. N.C. Howard, now of La Fruita, Texas accompanied me. His wife moved
                    to Richmond, and Uncle Wm. moved there before his death. I have been unable to
                    keep trace of his children.</p>
            <p>Richard went to Missouri soon after reaching his majority, became a Methodist
                    minister, married Mrs. Chappel. He became a chaplain of a Missouri regiment
                    during the Mexican war, and accompanied Gen. Kearney to New Mexico, and sickened
                    and died there. He had good success as a preacher, but dying young, he did not
                    have the opportunity to make as much mash as his brothers. He settled in
                    Callaway Co., Mo., 5 miles from Jefferson City. He was the father of two
                    daughters. One dying early. The other Mollie A. married Mr. Geo. W. Penn, a
                    Methodist minister, who is now a Presiding Elder. They have several children all
                    grown. Cousin M. visited us from Aug. 1865 to March 1859. Bro. John accompanied
                    her home remaining two weeks. I visited her in July and Aug. 1860. The family
                    has resided most of the time since the war in Fulton, Mo.</p>
            <p>Mary (Richard&apos;s twin) married a Mr. Nuckols. Four children was the
                    offspring. They then separated and Mr. N. took the two oldest (boys) with him to
                    Ky. But little has been heard of them since. The youngest son (Edwin) was killed
                    by falling from a cherry tree, while a small boy. The daughter married and when
                    last heard from lived in Orange Co., Va. Aunt M. died there some years ago. She
                    was rather peevish, beside which I know but little of her.</p>
            <p>Sarah A (the youngest) married her second cousin Robert Brooken. Lived at her
                    fathers two or three years, and in 1848, when my father visited Va. returned
                    with him, and lived in Henry Co., Tenn. till about 1870 when she died. She left
                    two children, Richard Battaile, and Fannie Jane. Richard B. was converted early
                    in life, attended Union University at Murfreesboro, Tenn. one term and was
                    ordained at the same time that I was, but did not preach regularily. His mind
                    became somewhat unhinged before his death about 1894. He was married first to
                    Miss McClain, who bore him one son John (now grown) and second to Miss Babe
                    Hendricks, who survive him. Fannie J. is still unmarried. Her mind to has been
                    unsettled two or three times. Both hers and her brothers were caused probably by
                    the intermarriage of near relatives. Their father Robert B. was a very kind-
                    hearted man, and one of the warmest friends I ever had. He was not a church
                    member, and though profane for greater part of his life gave evidence later of
                    being a christian. He died about 1890</p>

            <p>CHAPTER 2</p>
            <p>ROBERT RENNOLDS (MY FATHER)</p>
            <p>My father was born in 1805. He spent his minority on his father&apos;s farm,
                    attending school only 3 months. His Mother teaching him the &quot;three
                    R&apos;s&quot;. On reaching his majority he rented a farm in Orange Co. He soon
                    after went into the mercantile business with his brother William at Tolersville,
                    Louisa Co. the latter being the active partner. The crash of 1837 swept away the
                    capital invested. About this time he took charge of his father&apos;s farm, mill
                    and etc; and in Aug. 1838 he married Miss Jane Hansford at Esq. Nat Mills one
                    mile from Louisa C. H. taking her to his father&apos;s where he resided till
                    October 1841. His father had a distillery connected with his mill. Becoming
                    convinced that it was not right for him to be engaged in such a business, he
                    declined to longer manage his father&apos;s business unless he would abandon
                    distilling. His father refusing to do this, he prepared to move West. His father
                    then relented and proposed to cease distilling if he would remain, but he told
                    him it was too late, that his preparations to move were too far advanced. He
                    started to Christian Co. Ky. but learning at Nashville, Tenn. that land was very
                    high there, he changed his course to West Tenn. and reached Paris Henry Co.,
                    Nov. 14th 1841, with three hundred and forty and forty dollars, and three
                    slaves, Frank Jordan, about 60 years old, Charles about 18, and Lavina about 16.
                    He purchased 200 acres of land from Mr. James Griffin 8 miles north of Paris,
                    and 2 miles South of the present site of Puryear. By energy, economy and good
                    management he accumulated good property, owning at the close of the war 800
                    acres of land, and 15 slaves. He died May 20th 1871.</p>
            <p>He was tall, rawboned, had light complexion, blue eyes and reddish hair. A clear
                    head, and fine judgement. He was very conscientious, and charitable, never
                    turning the needy away empty. Was rather stern, but never harsh, loving his
                    family, but making no display of it. When a youth he attended a party, and
                    engaged in playing &quot;Weave the thimble.&quot; Reflecting over it, he
                    decided that it was wrong to engage in the play where he would be expected to
                    say that some one else had the thimble when he himself had it, and resolved not
                    to play it again. Attending another party soon, he forgot his vow, and played it
                    again. His conscience lashed him worse than before, and shocked at the evidence
                    of his inability to carry out resolves in his own strength, he felt the need of
                    power from a higher source and did not rest satisfied till he secured Divine
                    help for all future needs. His people were Methodists and he had been sprinkled
                    in infancy, but becoming dissatisfied with his so called baptism, he had a hard
                    struggle to settle the matter, finally convinced that immersion only was
                    baptism, he united with the 6____ Church in Orange Co. and was baptized.
                    Removing his membership to Elk Creek Church when he returned to his
                    father&apos;s he was soon licensed to preach, and was ordained at Shady Grove
                    Church.</p>
            <p>Not being in full sympathy at that time with the plan of missions he identified
                    himself with the Anti-Missionaries till about 1849 when he united with the
                    Missionary Baptists. His membership being at High Hill and Shady Grove. He
                    served as pastor at Spring Hill, Salem (Ky.), Shady Grove, Point Pleasant, Mt.
                    Zion,</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="0012_000244_000203_0006.jpg" xml:id="d3e329"/>
            <p>4</p>
            <p>Bird&apos;s Creek, and perhaps other churches.</p>
            <p>His mind was so engrossed with business affairs that he did not preach regularly.
                    Sometimes being pastor of 4 churches sometimes less, and sometimes more. He was
                    agent for Jas. B. Townly for 10 or 12 years in buying leaf tobacco, buying each
                    season 100 to 200 thousand lbs.</p>
            <p>He was moderator of Western District Baptist Asso. in 1862-3 and 4 and moderator
                    of the Minister&apos;s and Deacon&apos;s meeting of the Asso. for several
                    years.</p>
            <p>He was very conservative, especially in religion and politics. He was slow to
                    sanction secession but true to the step when taken. He was merciful to his
                    slaves, seldom chastizing them, doing so only under great provocation. He was
                    never willing to separate man and wife, several times buying one that they might
                    not be separated. Their affection for him was very strong.</p>
            <p>His neighbors were warmly attached to hem, as he was known to be true, and he
                    stimulated them to be so by trusting them, and I never knew of this trust being
                    betrayed.</p>
            <p>He was often urged to be a candidate for office, but always refused, deeming it
                    incompatible with his calling as a minister. He once stumpted the county in
                    connection with Rev. Ben Peeples (afterwards Co. Judge) trying to induce the
                    people not to levy a tax on themselves to build the Nashville and Northwestern
                    R.R. in which they succeeded. Many persons regretted bitterly that they did not
                    also decline to be taxed to build the Memphis and Ohio R.R.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 3</p>
            <p>THE HANSFORD FAMILY</p>
            <p>The Virginia family of this name came from some County in England north of
                    London, (perhaps Hertfordshire) about 150 or 200 years ago, and settled in King
                    George Co. I regret very much that I cannot now recollect what my mother has
                    told me about them. They were members of the Church of England, and with the
                    Wallace&apos;s and others formed the Lomb&apos;s Creek Parish, and built a brick
                    church with material imported from England, ships from E. coming for tobacco,
                    bringing brick cheap as ballast.</p>
            <p>My grandfather Theodosius Hansford settled on the dividing ridge between the
                    Potomac and Rappahannocks Rivers, from whose yard steamers could be seen in both
                    rivers in the winter time. His name was Theodosious Hansford, and his
                    father&apos;s name was Stephen Hansford. He had a good classical education,
                    owned a good farm supplied with slaves. He was a magistrate, with a life tenure,
                    and also a surveyor. He studied law, but did not practice but little.</p>
            <p>In 1800 he was appointed Clerk of the State Senate, at a salary of ten dollars
                    per day. He served in this capacity till his death in 1825. He wrote a plain
                    hand, so plain even, as almost to be read as readily as print.</p>
            <p>He was married twice. First to Miss Woodford who bore him three children, Eliza,
                    Addison and Jefferson, and secondly to Miss Jane Thornly, who bore him three,
                    Jane, Edwin and Laura. Eliza was never married. After her fathers death she
                    lived with an Aunt in Woodford Co., Ky., where she died about 25 years ago. She
                    had a fine mind, was well educated, and inherited all the</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="0012_000244_000203_0007.jpg" xml:id="d3e360"/>
            <p>5</p>
            <p>pride of F. F. V. ancestry. She was devoted to her relatives. Addison assisted
                    his father in the office of clerk, for several years, and at his death succeeded
                    him in the position, holding it till his own death in 1850. He was a fine
                    business man, and accumulated a fortune (about a hundred thousand dollars). In
                    his later years he succumbed to the drink habit. He married Miss Julia Wallace.
                    His posterity consisted of two sons, Stephen and Addison, and daughters. Stephen
                    died unmarried. Addison married and reared a large family on the farm inherited
                    from his father, and died several years ago. Of the daughters, I do not
                    know.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 4</p>
            <p>MY MOTHER</p>
            <p>Miss Jane Hansford was born in 1810. Her mother died when she waas not more than
                    6 years old. An old maid, Miss Lucy Mc Williams, was installed as house-keeper,
                    ans was entrusted with caring for the younger children. She was kind to them,
                    and could tell them a great deal about their ancestry, and most of the families
                    in the county. Hence was dubbed by Uncle Jefferson as &quot;Old Chronicles&quot;</p>
            <p>On the death of her father in her 15th year, my mother&apos;s property fell into
                    the hands of Tom Smith, (brother of Gov. &quot;Extra Billy&quot; Smith) who
                    persuaded her to select him as guardian, and who squandered all but the land.
                    She had been sent by her father a term or two to Mrs. Hackley&apos;s Academy,
                    near the Wilderness battlefield. She remained in her brother Addison&apos;s
                    family for several years, obtaining some more education. She then went to live
                    with her Uncle Berry Thornly, and acted as housekeeper for him for sometime. She
                    then went, in the latter part of the year 1832, to live with her mother&apos;s
                    half sister, Mrs. Helen Hutchison near Jordansville, who had been recently left
                    a widow for the second time. Her last husband had been postmaster at
                    Charlottsville. Here my mother remained, probably 4 or 5 years, teaching school
                    part of the time. About 1846 or 7 she went to teach school near Esq. Nat
                    Mills&apos;, in Louisa Co., where she met my father and where there were married
                    in August 1838.</p>
            <p>She was very low in stature, round and plump, when young, with black hair, and
                    hazel eyes. She had an excellent knowledge. Her father brought a fine selection,
                    of books home from Richmond, each speing on his return from the Legislature, and
                    in his library she drank in full draughts of knowledge. She was a friend to all,
                    and was ever ready to recognize a good quality in even the meanest person, but
                    had a supreme contempt for a mean action from the most saspiring. She was
                    sprinkled into the Espicopalian church in infancy but becoming convinced that
                    immersion only was baptism, she was baptized at Birds Creek and then joined High
                    Hill, though she had been converted several years before. She toiled day and
                    night to secure the comfort of her husband, children and slaves. Many a night
                    have I waked up and found her making clothes for the negroes, when all others on
                    the place were sound asleep. I might write whole pages about her, but I forbear.
                    She died Nov. 19th 1881 from a fall down a stairway, surviving only about a
                    minute.</p>

            <p>CHAPTER 5</p>
            <p>MY BROTHERS ANS SISTERS</p>
            <p>My eldest brother, John Stockdell was born August 30th, 1841. Was very small at
                    birth, and was carried to Tenn. on a common pillow in the wagon. Had fair
                    complexion, blue eyes, and reddish hair. Had a good mind, was very studious, and
                    advanced rapidly. Cared but little for young ladies society, was bashful, and
                    reserved among strangers, conscientious, and true in all relations.</p>
            <p>He entered the Confederate Army, in the 5th Tenn. Inf. May 20th, 1861, and was
                    elected 4th Corporal, and made a good soldier. He had fever during the battle of
                    Shiloh, but said nothing about it. Reaching camp at Corinth April 9th, 1862, he
                    took his bed with Typhoid fever, and lingered till April 17th, when he died, and
                    was buried with military honors near Corinth. Though he never made and open
                    profession of religion, I think he was converted 3 or 4 years before his
                    death.</p>
            <p>The next William Reuben was born August 1st, 1845. He was converted and joined
                    High Hill Church, during the war. He married Miss Emma Porter Williams, daughter
                    of Esq. Ziba Williams, about 1871, and settled on the part of his father&apos;s
                    farm, left him in his will, on Phillips Creek, where he remained till about
                    1890, when he removed to Puryear, where he now resides.</p>
            <p>May, Robert and -----</p>
            <p>Virginia Sarah was born November 28th, 1847. She married Mr. Adam Harmon in the
                    autumn of 1871. He died in 1873, and their child born afterwards, lived only a
                    few weeks. She married William S. Martin. They have four children, Edna, Nellie,
                    Louis and ----. They now reside at West Point, Tenn. She was converted during
                    the war and joined High Hill Church.</p>
            <p>Thomas Battaile was born Sept. 12th, 1849. He married Miss Malissie Rowe,
                    December---. They have only one child, Hansford, who is married to Miss
                    Valentine. They have lost a daughter, only a few years old. They reside on a
                    farm about 3 miles S. E. of Puryear, Tenn. He was converted and joined High Hill
                    church in autumn of 1871 or 2, being baptized by myself.</p>
            <p>Alice Hay was born January 20th, 1854. Was married to Mr. Thomas McClain. She has
                    two daughters, who live with their father in Calloway Co., Ky. She is engaged in
                    the millinery business at Puryear, Tenn. She was converted and joined High Hill
                    church, and was baptized by myself with her brother (Thomas).</p>

            <p>EDWIN HANSFORD RENNOLDS SR.</p>
            <p>MY BOYHOOD AND SCHOOL DAYS</p>
            <p>I was born at my grandfather&apos;s residence, Locust Gove, Va. 1 1/2 miles N. W.
                    of Frederick&apos;s Hall, Louisa Co., Va., Oct. 30th 1839. Being the first
                    Grandchild in the family, I was very much petted, and was the idol of my
                    grandfather, then almost in his dotage. I was carried to Tenn. when the family
                    removed there in the Autumn of 1841. Having no chid to play with, I cucceeded in
                    getting into much mischief, by knocking off all the trunk hasps, all the hoops
                    from the barrels, and cutting my mother&apos;s wedding ring in two with an
                    axe.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="0012_000244_000203_0009.jpg" xml:id="d3e411"/>
            <p>7</p>
            <p>My first recollection is of telling my mother a falsehood, by accusing my little
                    brother John of breaking a looking glass, which I had shattered with a
                    peach-stone. I was then only a little over 4 years old, and yet the rememberance
                    of it is clear to my memory.</p>
            <p>At a little over 6 years of age, I was sent to school to Mr. John Shell at Clear
                    Creek Church about 2 1/2 miles N. W. of my father&apos;s residence (Woodlawn).
                    For the first three weeks, my father carried me on horseback, and went after me
                    in the afternoon. The he left me to walk with James H. Stephens, an orphan boy
                    living with him. I was small, so the larger girls treated me as a baby, keeping
                    me much in their laps at play-time. I recollect but few incidents of this
                    school.</p>
            <p>The next year 1847, I attended the school of Mr. Jefferson Hill, about half a
                    mile N. W. of where Foundry Hill Baptist Church now stands. In 1848 I attended
                    the school of Rev. Whitson a Baptist preacher, on the spot where High Hill
                    Church stood until recently. In 1849 and 50 the school of my cousin Joseph Bell
                    about 3/4 of a mile south of where the present town of Puryear stands today. In
                    1851, the school of Mr. Pitchegru Quarles, about 3/4 of a mile East of my
                    father&apos;s residence. In 1852 and 3 the school of Mr. John Terry at the same
                    place.</p>
            <p>In August 1856 my father carried me to New Boston Academy (10 miles S. W.) and
                    left me to board with Mr. James H. Howard, &quot;Uncle Jimmie&quot; and &quot;Aunt Jackie&quot; were very kind to me, and this helped to soften the sad
                    feeling at being among entire strangers, and I formed a strong friendship for
                    their youngest son Nathaniel Calvin, which was fully reciprocated by him, and
                    has lasted through all the subsequent years.</p>
            <p>The teachers here were Prof. Robert B. Koen, and Prof. W. Green Randle. Prof.
                    Koen served as Adjt. of the 38th Tenn. Inf. and since the war has been engaged
                    in the nursery business at Collierville, Tenn. and Memphis. Prof. Randle became
                    a Methodist minister, moved to Texas for his health and died there some years
                    ago.</p>
            <p>At this Academy I was thrown with young men of more aspirations than my former
                    associates, which had the effect to arouse greater ambitions in my own heart. I
                    joined the Alpha-Pi-Rho Literary Society, and first engaged in extempore
                    speaking in the debates. I commenced the study of Algebra and Latin. I made good
                    use of the Society&apos;s Library, and devoured the contents of volume after
                    volume, at the rate of two of Jacob Abbot&apos;s biographies a week.</p>
            <p>The session closed at Christmas and I returned home. Found Mr. W. E. Fling of
                    northern Vermont, teaching in the neighborhood, and boarding at my
                    father&apos;s. My father decided for me to study under him, and as there were no
                    others in the same classes, I studied at home and recited at night. Without the
                    stimulus of classmates I tired of this in a few weeks, and asked to be allowed
                    to go to work, which I would have had to do soon, anyhow. My request was
                    granted.</p>
            <p>In January 1858 I was sent again to New Boston Academy. But alas its glory had
                    departed. The loved teachers were gone, and their places were supplied by a
                    brother and son of my host. Rev. Jno. R. Howard principal was a Campbellite
                    preacher. He knew nothing outside of books and but little of how to teach what
                    was in them, was cranky, if not partly deranged, and was an inveter-</p>

            <p>8</p>
            <p>ate user of snuff and asafaetida. His nephew Marmican S. Howard Esq., was a good
                    man, but without a liberal education, and having been on a farm all his life was
                    devoid of the knowledge of pedagogies. The school had dwindled down from 80 to
                    about 40 pupils, but few of these were boarders, and but few in advanced classes
                    even for an Academy, and I missed the &quot;Competition that is not only the
                    life of trade&quot; but of many other things. I failed to learn much of Latin
                    or Mathematics. I secured the honors of the school, such as they were. I
                    returned to my father&apos;s farm in June. My parents and Miss Julia Jobe having
                    attended the closing exercises, and my mother was very proud of the position I
                    have attained.</p>
            <p>The first four of the schools I have mentioned as attending near home were summer
                    sessions, commencing in March and continue ig 5 months. The others were winter
                    schools, commencing in October and closing about March first. After this date I
                    would spend the time from March to Oct. on the farm working at anything that was
                    to be done. I neglected to say that while attending the last session at New
                    Boston I improved in speaking, and served as Secretary and President of the A.
                    P. R. Society.</p>
            <p>I spent the latter half of the year 1858 working on the farm, but my father did
                    not require me to stick to it quite so closely as before. Our cousin Mary A.
                    Rennolds of Calloway Co., Mo. visited us in August. Her half-brother Alexander
                    Chappell accompanied her, and remained several days. She remained till the
                    spring of 1859, when Brother John accompanied her home, and remained a few days.
                    During the year we attended the county fair, school examinations, religious
                    meetings, barbecues, social gatherings and etc, and the humdrum life of the farm
                    was somewhat broken. It was perhaps the most enjoyed of any year of my life, as
                    it was free from the responsibilities which have weighed upon me since then, and
                    the relaxations from close confinement to manual labor was very agreeable
                    indeed.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 7</p>
            <p>AS A SCHOOL TEACHER</p>
            <p>At the close of a hard days work, rolling logs in the meadows in Feb. 1859, Mr.
                    Joseph B. Crawford, a neighbor and old schoolmate rode up, and said to me that a
                    new school-house had been erected about 1 1/2 miles S. W. of my father&apos;s,
                    and that the school patrons wished me to teach a summer school of five months.
                    This was quite staggering to me as the thought of such a thing had never entered
                    my mind. I told him that as a minor I would have to be guided by my
                    father&apos;s wishes in the matter. Upon asking his opinion of it, he replied
                    that perhaps I had best comply with their wishes. I wrote out a subscription
                    paper and Mr. Crawford circulated it, and soon returned it with the names of all
                    the patrons, who agreed to pay me at the rate of one dollar per month, per
                    pupil, some ageeing to send one pupil some two and others more, agregating about
                    21 I think.</p>
            <p>On Monday March 21st, 1859, I began to teach with about 20 pupils, which number
                    increased to about 35, but did not average more than 25, three of whom were two
                    of my brothers, and sister, and two were my cousins (Richard and Fannie). Among
                    the number, fourteen who did not know the alphabet. The children of two or three
                    families were very stupid, but several were very bright.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="0012_000244_000203_0011.jpg" xml:id="d3e453"/>
            <p>9</p>
            <p>I did not have an easy time by any means. Many of them had never been inside a
                    schoolroom. It was not a congenial occupation. It is one thing to be able to
                    learn books, but it is quite another thing to be successful in imparting this
                    knowledge to others. However the school was rated a success, but would not now
                    at this day of advanced methods be considered quite a failure. I spent the hours
                    of recess reading, but not neglecting to keep a sharp lookout as to the
                    where-abouts of the pupils, and there behavior. I with the help of the boys
                    cleaned the treetops from around the school-house, and added to the appearance
                    of the surroundings, keeping the yard neatly swept.</p>
            <p>A barbecue was given the school on Saturday, July 2nd, my father reading the
                    Declaration of Independence and myself making my first original patriotic
                    speech, written, and then memorized. A couple of other speeches followed. The
                    school closed at the end of five months with an examination and exhibition.</p>
            <p>I spent a few weeks on the farm, and about October 1st commenced a public school
                    at the same place, continueing five months and for which I recieved one hundred
                    and twenty-five dollars, which made me feel ver proud indeed. I loaned one
                    hundred of it to my father, and when the war was over, it with interest ($150.)
                    I found very helpful.</p>
            <p>I spent the months of March, April, May and June building dining-room, porch, and
                    closet additions to my father&apos;s residence, and working on the farm. July
                    10th I started on a visit to Cousin Mary A. Rennolds, in Calloway Co., Missouri,
                    going by rail from Paris to Columbus, Ky. and steamer A. B. Chambers to
                    Jefferson City. Was absent about six weeks, and enjoying the trip very much,
                    getting my first glimpse of the outer world.</p>
            <p>On first Monday in Sept. I commenced another public school at Phillips Creek (as
                    before). At the end of six weeks the public money being exhausted I closed the
                    school and entered school at Conyersville Male and Female Academy, where my
                    brother John had been attending for about two years. I went from home, riding
                    most of the time. Studied Algebra, Geometry, Arithmetic, composition and etc,
                    and on approach of Christmas holiday closed my school life, having reached my
                    majority Oct. 30th 1860, and casting my first vote six days later for
                    Breckinridge and Lane for Pres. and Vice Pres.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 8</p>
            <p>COMMENCEMENT OF THE WAR</p>
            <p>I commenced life for myself Jan. 1st 1861, by agreeing to take charge of my
                    father&apos;s farm at the salary of $150. per year, and continued with him till
                    the middle of May, when it was rather abruptly ended by my entering the
                    army.</p>
            <p>The disputes between the North and South in reference to the extension of Slavery
                    into the territories, had been growing hotter for several years. The election
                    ofa Republican (or abolition) President, Nov. 5th 1860 precipitated a conflict.
                    State after State of the South decided to secede from the Union, and the
                    Confederate States of America was formed. Tennessee declined to secede by a
                    popular vote in Feb. 1861, but later, called a session of the Legislature
                    decided to organize an army to cooperate with</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="0012_000244_000203_0012.jpg" xml:id="d3e479"/>
            <p>10</p>
            <p>the Confederate States and re-submit the question of Separation at the August
                    election.</p>
            <p>Col. Wm. E. Travis was authorized to raise a regiment, and he with Gen. J. D. C.
                    Atkins, and other speakers went from village to village in the county, and with
                    the Paris Cornet Band, with speeches and Martial music fired the hearts of the
                    people. Saturday April 20th 1861, a mass meeting was held at Paris, Tenn., and
                    after several speeches were made a parade was formed in the courtyard, and as
                    they marched around the building, all who were willing to enter the service were
                    invited to fall in line. I had no idea of joining when I went to town that
                    morning, but seeing so many of my friends in line I decided that it was the best
                    time enlist and fell in. The column proceeded to the grounds of the Male
                    Academy, and a temporary organization was effected, 8 companies of 26 men each
                    counted off, with directions to each to elect a Captain and two lieutenants. I
                    happened to fall into the company which elected B. B. Bunch Jr. as Capt. but as
                    each recruit was allowed to change companies, if he was fit, at any time prior
                    to being sworn in, I availed myself of this privilege to change to a company
                    which contained more of my paricular friends.</p>
            <p>The next month was spent in working up the enthusiasm and recruiting the
                    companies, and on Monday May 20th the permanent organization was effected in
                    McNeil&apos;s grove (Paris) by being sworn in and bu electing W. E. Travis Col.,
                    J. D. C. Atkins Lt. Col. and W. C. Swor Major. The company to which I was
                    attached (Co. K.) elected H. W. Ballard Capt., G. C. Street 1st Lieut., W. E.
                    Harris 2nd Lieut., R. A. Brisendine 3rd Lieut. or brevet 2nd., J. W. Howard 1st
                    Sergt., Wm. McClure 2nd Sergt., D. P. McClure 3rd Sergt., E. H. Rennolds 4th
                    Sergt., J. W. Pillow 5th Sergt., W. B. Duff, J. M. B. Elliot, Phillip Kennerly,
                    and John S. Rennolds Corporals. My father having advised me to secure some kind
                    of an office, if only a non-commissioned one, to save me from standing guard
                    duty, I offered for 3rd Lieut. and was beaten by 3 votes.</p>
            <p>No transportation being procurable on account of the great demand on the R.
                    R&apos;s to move troops we were ordered to rendezvous on Wednesday. On that
                    Morning my brother John and I bade the loved ones goodby, and went to Paris. No
                    transportation being secured we were ordered to rendez- vous again Friday.
                    Comrades T. G. Morris Kr., J. F. Parker, C. B. Provine, brother John and myself
                    spent the night, Thursday and T. night at Rev. Asa Cox&apos;s, 3 miles N. W. of
                    Paris going fishing with the girls, Misses Annie and Margaret on Thursday, and
                    having a good time. On Friday 24th we returned to Paris, and 6 Companies were
                    sent by rail to Humbolt Camp of Instruction under Command of Lt. Col. Atkins,
                    brother John and I spent night with Alonzo Pillow over Hick&apos;s store taking
                    supper and breakfast at Southerlin House. Saturday about 1 P.M. we took the
                    train amid the waving of handkerchiefs and tears of relatives and friends, and
                    thus four years of war was commenced. Our regiment was numbered 5th Tenn. Inf.
                    and the Co. &quot;K&quot;, afterwards &quot;D&quot;.</p>

            <p>CHAPTER 9</p>
            <p>DRILLING AND PREPARING</p>
            <p>We remained at Humbolt only about a week, when with the other troops we were
                    transferred to Union City, and here spent the months of June, July and August
                    drilling. Finding this hard and warm work I had written to my father, asking
                    that he send my brother and I a cook, and he sent us Fielding, who proved a
                    faithful servant. Our mess consisted of A. H. Duggar, Phillip Kennerly, James F.
                    Parker, W. D. Hendricks, Alonzo Pillow, brother John and myself. Hardly a day
                    passed that some one or more persons from Henry Co., were not in Camp, and many
                    delicacies from home found their way to our tables. The citizens from the
                    country also brought in many vegetables and sold them at reasonable prices.
                    Gradually we learned the drill, but were not proficient in it.</p>
            <p>During the summer measles broke out in Camp and raged fiercely, twenty-three were
                    taken in our Co. in one night, three of whom were in our mess. I was glad I had
                    already passed through the experience. On the first Thursday in Aug. all of us
                    who were old enough to vote, except a few officers, were allowed to go home on
                    furlough to vote, and the miners a few days later. The State decided by a large
                    majority to separate from the U. S. and unite with the C. S. and its troops were
                    transferred to the C. S. Army. Lieut. Col. Atkins having been elected to the C.
                    S. Congress, Adjt. C. D. Venable was elected Lieut. Col. and Lieut. Joe. T.
                    Kendall appointed Adjt. The 1st, 4th, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th and 22nd were also
                    encamped at Union City and some regiments from other states, also some Cavalry
                    and some Artillery.</p>
            <p>About Sept. 1st we moved by rail to Columbus, Ky. and fortified the place. A few
                    days later a march was made, ( several other regiments assisting ) to Mayfield,
                    and back the second day. This march was very trying to men not yet recovered
                    strength from the measles. When the fort was completed, Jones Battalion
                    (afterwards the 55th Regt.) 5th Tenn. Inf., and a battalion of Heavy Art. under
                    Maj. Jackson, formed the garrison, Brig. Gen. A. P. Stewart commanding. Most of
                    the time till March 1st was spent in strengthening the works, and felling the
                    timber on both sides of the river. Nov. 7th the Federals came down from Cairo
                    and attacked two regiments, and a battery on the Missouri side of the river, and
                    the Battle of Belmont resulted. Troops were sent over and the enemy driven back.
                    I had a pretty good view of the battle from the bluff, and thus, saw fighting
                    before actually engaged.</p>
            <p>The winter of 1861 and 2 was rather pleasantly spent. Housed in a comfortable
                    &quot;shanty,&quot; with a good stove, (of our own purchase,) books to read,
                    but little work to do, after real winter set in, no drilling, regular letters
                    from home, and occassional visit from friends and relatives, and no immediate
                    prospect of fighting. Many a time afterward, when enduring the real hardships of
                    war, we longed for &quot;luxuries&quot; we enjoyed at Columbus.</p>
            <p>The Capture of Ft. Henry on Tennessee River, and of Ft. Donelson on Cumberland
                    River, rendered our position untenable, and early in March the works at Columbus
                    were evacuated and we took steamers to New Madrid, Mo. and Island No. 10. While
                    on picket at New Madrid, a Federal Cavalryman rode up near our lines, and the
                    whole line after a few men had fired their guns in the direction of the &quot;scout&quot;, broke and fled, except Private W. T. Browning</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="0012_000244_000203_0014.jpg" xml:id="d3e513"/>

            <p>and myself. We followed in a walk, seeing nothing to flee from.</p>
            <p>Another day, in a slight skirmish with some of the enemy&apos;s advanced
                    skirmishers, Capt. W. D. Hallum, of Co. &quot;I&quot; was slightly wounded in
                    the neck, the first blood shed in the regiment, unless we except Private Bob
                    Tyler of Co. M. who contrary to orders crossed the river with other troops, and
                    was killed at Belmont.</p>
            <p>One dark rainy night we evacuated New Madrid, and took boats to Island 10. Here I
                    was taken sick and sent with others to Tiptonville where the Regt. passed us on
                    its way to Ft. Pillow. Next day we were put on a boat and taken to Hospital at
                    Memphis. The boat landed for a few minutes at Ft. Pillow, and I saw several of
                    the boys of our Regt. I spent one night in Overton (Hotel) Hospital. Tandy G.
                    Morris and others also. Next morning some members of the Regt. came in and said
                    the Regt. had come down on a boat and would take the train to Corinth. Though
                    not well I left the hospital and went to the M. and C. Depot, and later in the
                    day we took the train, arriving at Corinth late in the evening. I suffered with
                    a terrible headache all the way, the noise of the soldiers cheering at the
                    groups of ladies gathered at every depot and cross-road, seemed almost like a
                    knife striking through my head. Elijah McClure kindly held my head in his lap
                    all the way, after finding that I was suffering. I shall never forget his
                    kindness.</p>
            <p>Our cooking vessels not reaching us for a couple of days, we had to make up our
                    bread-dough in any old vessel obtainable, and cook Johnny-cakes, rolled around
                    sticks or flattened on a board before the fire. The excessive rain made it more
                    unpleasant also. Many of the men contracted dysentery here and at Island 10 and
                    Tiptonville.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 10</p>
            <p>THE BATTLE OF SHILOH</p>
            <p>The Federals having come up the Tennessee River to Pittsburg Landing, Gen. A. S.
                    Johnston in command at Corinth determined to attack them under Gen. U. S. Grant
                    before the arrival of reenforcements under Gen. Buell marching from
                    Nashville.</p>
            <p>So on April 4th 1862, wwe were marched out from Corinth. We had been placed in
                    Gen. A. P. Stewart&apos;s Brigade composed of 4th Tenn. 5th, 13th Ark. and some
                    other Regt. Although we were within a few miles of the enemy&apos;s camp on
                    night of the 4th, the roads were muddy and narrow and woods thick with
                    undergrowth that we had to wait all day of the 5th for other commands to come
                    up. Our Brigade was in Clark&apos;s Division and Polk&apos;s Corps.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 6th we filed out of the road, and formed line of battle. We
                    were in the third line, there being three lines and a reserve in addition. The
                    artillery soon began firing, and soon after the crack of muskets, and then the
                    roar of small arms. This soon took off the edge of our excitement and fear, and
                    we were soon advancing, following the first line. While crossing a small field
                    in a narrow valley, a grape shot struck Private J. Perry Murrell, of our Co. (K)
                    and killed him. He fell so nearly in front of me that I had to turn aside to
                    keep from running over him. He was the first one of the Co. killed. On a little
                    ridge just beyond the field we were halted, and re-alignment made. Here a shell
                    exploded near the colors, and several</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="0012_000244_000203_0015.jpg" xml:id="d3e538"/>
            <p>13</p>
            <p>men wounded, creating some excitement.</p>
            <p>In a few minutes we were again ordered forward. The fighting in front had by this
                    time become very heavy, but compared to firing in other battles would afterward
                    have been considered desultory. After advancing a few hundred yards further we
                    came up with a regiment engaged in firing at the enemy in front. This regiment
                    was formed at an angle with the line of advance in which we were, and our
                    regiment extending further to the left than it, 3 or 4 companies of ours were
                    uncovered, and commenced firing in front, no enemy being visible to me however.
                    Being a file closer, and not being in position to shoot, I could observe what
                    was done. Many of the men fired with their guns elevated at an angle of about 45
                    degrees. After a round or so the command came to cease firing, and in a few
                    minutes we moved forward again. We soon came in sight of a camp of the enemy,
                    among which we could see a line of soldiers, which was taken for the enemy, and
                    fire was opened on them. The color-bearer ran out in full view and waved his
                    flag which was recognized as a confederate one and the firing ceased. From the
                    description of it by Col. A. H. Helvenston of Sumterville this must have been
                    the 16th Ala. of which he was Major and afterwards colonel. As we were nearing
                    this camp a shell exploded in our ranks and killed and wounded several. Private
                    Alex McMullen of our Co. was wounded, and I think, Private A. H. Duggar
                    also.</p>
            <p>We found plenty of cooke food in the tents, and at the request of the men in line
                    I carried them as much of it as the limited halt would permit. Some found their
                    way into a settler&apos;s tent, and the pillaging commenced which is always
                    demoralizing.</p>
            <p>Not a great way beyond the encampment we took the front, and henceforward we were
                    in the heat of battle. As we were going down a hill in a body of woods Private
                    F. M. Sinsel fell with a death wound, his cap rolling down the hill and lodging
                    against a tree. Many others were killed and wounded along here.</p>
            <p>My mind fails to recall what occurred until we captured Gen. Prentiss&apos;
                    Division, late in the day. Some other command had while advancing at a smart
                    angle to ours come in on one side of them while we came in on another. Some of
                    the Federals were running out at the open space between our commands, and seeing
                    one I fired at him, and saw him go off limping, but as others were firing, I
                    could not tell who hit him.</p>
            <p>We had now driven the enemy to the cover of the bluff, and while we were sending
                    the prisoners to the rear, and correcting our alignment, the guboats in the
                    river began a terrific bombardment with their guns, and never having seen such
                    heavy artillery firing before I thought it terrible and expected to see our
                    troops exterminated, and many others shared my feeling. We were in the timber
                    and the shells striking the trees mostly in our rear, tumbled them in every
                    direction. We were ordered to fall back out of their range, and this we did in
                    short order. In the hurry our regiment was separated from the rest of the
                    command, and night coming on we bivouacked for the night. I went down into a
                    ravine to fill my canteen and almost stumbled over a dead man, Ugh! how it made
                    my blood run cold.</p>
            <p>The little log Baptist Church named Shiloh was near the center of the
                    battle-field and gave the name to the battle. It was made a field hospital.</p>
            <p>Our faithful cook Fielding hunted us up next morning, after much trouble, and
                    brought us cooked rations which were much enjoyed</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="0012_000244_000203_0016.jpg" xml:id="d3e560"/>
            <p>14</p>
            <p>by us. Mr. Thos. Reynolds, a printer in the Memphis Appeal office who was a
                    cousin of Mr. A. H. Dugger of our mess, and who had followed us from Memphis to
                    be in the fight, and who fought like a tiger on the first day was taken
                    violently sick with cramp colic on this morning and Fielding carried him off the
                    battlefield on his back, and as Mr. R. said to me afterwards in Atlanta, saved
                    his life.</p>
            <p>Gen. W. J. Hardee finding our regiment on the morning of the second day separated
                    from its own command, ordered the Lieut. Col. (Venable) to form in his line, and
                    we fought with it through the remainder of the battle. We were posted in front
                    of a field and several times advanced partly through it. But the heavy
                    reinforcements of Buell, who had arrived made it impossible to drive back the
                    line, and after fighting here bravely till about 3 P. M. Gen. G. T. Beauregard
                    who had succeeded Gen. A. S. Johnston who was killed on the first day, ordered
                    us to fall back to Corinth. We marched a few miles and bivouacked in the rain,
                    which poured down all night.</p>
            <p>Next day we continued our straggling march in the mud and water reaching Corinth
                    late in the evening. Only the Col. and about half a dozen men arriving with the
                    colors.</p>
            <p>Brother John did not reach camp till the next evening, when I found he had
                    Typhoid Fever. He clung to his gun and accoutrements although hardly able to
                    walk, and spent the night of the 8th sleeping by the roadside in the rain.
                    During the battle he must have had fever, as he would ask me every time we
                    crosse water to fill his cup for him, and drank it ravenously. But inexperienced
                    as I was I did not think of his being sick. I secured a place for him in a
                    private house near camp, and getting a mattress from a teamster made him as
                    comfortable as I could. Mr. A. H. Langford and another man was sick in the same
                    room. Fielding was faithful and did all he could. Others helped me sit up with
                    him, but on the 17th he died and we buried him there with military honors.
                    Lieut. W. E. Harris seeing that he was decently buried.</p>
            <p>On the 27th, Pa and Cousin Robert B. Rennolds came down to see us having heard
                    John was sick. As Fielding was sick, and wanted to go home, I agreed to it, and
                    he accompanied them back, and thenceforward I took my part in the cooking.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 11</p>
            <p>SUMMER OF 1862</p>
            <p>Before the term of enlistment (one year) expired Congress enacted the &quot;Conscript Law&quot; requiring all of us between 18 and 35 years of age to serve
                    two years longer. A great many deserted and returned home. One-third of our Co.
                    going (39 in all out of 117). At the reorganization which the law provided for
                    C. D. Venable was elected Col., W. C. Swor Lt. Col. and J. J. Lamb Maj. The 12
                    companies were reduced to 10 by consolidating the four smallest ones into two.
                    Our Co. became &quot;D&quot;.</p>
            <p>None of the officers desiring to be Captain, Adjt. J. T. Kendall was elected
                    Capt., W. E. Harris 1st Lieut., J. W. Howard 2nd Lieut., and J. M. B. Elliot 3rd
                    Lieut. I was elected orderly Sergt. defeating C. P. Walker by a good
                    majority.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="0012_000244_000203_0017.jpg" xml:id="d3e585"/>
            <p>15</p>
            <p>Soon after the battle of Shiloh the enemy began to advance on Corinth, and we
                    fortified the place. They advanced by gradual approaches, and skirmishes
                    occurred daily. By the latter part of May we were hemmed in on three sides and
                    our last line of R. R. (Mobile and Ohio) cut.</p>
            <p>On the night of May 29th (I think) we evacuated the place, and retreated to
                    Tupelo, Miss., halting awhile at Baldwin. I was sick and failed to keep up being
                    barely able to walk.</p>
            <p>Next morning I met with Mr. C. P. Walker, who was even sicker than I was, and we
                    kept together till we overtook the command at Baldwin. We had to make a detour
                    to avoid the enemy, and barely missing capture. Had Mr. Walker been alone he
                    would have succumbed, as I could hardly arouse him from slumber when we
                    rested.</p>
            <p>Most of the months June and July and part of August were spent in drilling at
                    Tupelo, Miss. becoming far more efficient than before. Not much occurred that
                    need to be recorded here.</p>
            <p>Sometime in August we started to Kentucky. Went by rail to Mobile, and our
                    regiment by boat to Montgomery, and then by rail to Chattanooga. Went into camp
                    at a spring on the Western side of Mission Ridge, between where the present
                    sites of Ridgedale and Highland Park are. Drilling two hours each day, two miles
                    west on the road from Chattanooga to La Fayette, Ga.</p>
            <p>When our wagon train came up, we started marching, crossing Walden&apos;s Ridge
                    and Cumberland Mountain. The latter at night, so that we would not suffer so
                    much for water which was scarce. Waded the Cumberland River near Gainesboro. We
                    found the people of Ky. very hospitable, and capturing the garrison and supplies
                    at Mumfordsville, we fared sumptuously. We went as far as Bardstown and when
                    Buell came out in force from Louisville we retired to Harrodsburg.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 12</p>
            <p>BATTLE OF PERRYVILLE</p>
            <p>On the 8th of October 1862, we countermarched to Perryville and engaged the
                    enemy. Cheatham&apos;s Division was formed in two lines of two brigades each.
                    Our Brigade (Stewart&apos;s) being in the 2nd line. The first line stormed and
                    captured Chaplain&apos;s Hill, capturing a battery. When we were ordered up to
                    support them, we passed the dismantled battery, and saw they were engaging the
                    enemy at a lane two or three hundred yards beyond. Down the slope through the
                    smooth open field we doublequicked, Corporal Bob Harris being killed on the way.
                    Our approach frightened the enemy and they gave way. We passed the lane where
                    the horses of the battery caissons were lying killed, and fought the enemy
                    through a small woods pasture, and up a hill in a cornfield. By this time the
                    line was abandoned and men were fighting singly, scattered along for some
                    distance. I with many others slowed up and then halted for the men to close up.
                    Dropping on my left knee I rested my right elbow on my right knee and rested the
                    butt of my musket on the ground supported it with my right hand. While in this
                    position a bullet pierced my right arm just above the wrist making a flesh wound
                    but deadening my arm so I could not use my gun. I took the gun in my left hand
                    and laid it on the ground, unbuttoned my jacketsleeve, and slipped the sleeve up
                    my arm, thus pulling both jacket and shirt sleeve from the wound into which the
                    ball</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="0012_000244_000203_0018.jpg" xml:id="d3e610"/>
            <p>16</p>
            <p>had driven them, when the blood flowed freely. I said to my friend Sergt. N. C.
                    Howard who happened to be near me, (though in another Co.) &quot;I am wounded.&quot; He said to me &quot;you had better go to the rear.&quot; I retreated
                    down the hill where I found Mr. Boden, who had a ball fast in his gun, and was
                    trying to dislodge it, and asked him to take my handkerchief and fold it and
                    bind it around my arm, pinning it on, which he did. I had no canteen and began
                    to be thirsty from loss of blood. I continued up through the pasture and soon
                    reached high enough ground for the balls from the cornfield to be flying thick,
                    and I increased my speed to a run. Seeing a Yankee canteen on the ground I
                    snatched it as I ran, and stopping behind a tree I found it full, and slaked my
                    thirst freely. I soon passed Color-Sarg. Josie B. Jones, who had his leg broken
                    by a ball but had lowered himself by the staff to the ground and held up the
                    colors till one of the color guard came. His heavy weight had torn the litter on
                    which he had been placed, and the men of the infirmary corps were carrying him
                    off on their backs by turns. Seeing me he said &quot;Ed they have wounded me
                    but they have not whipped me yet.&quot; Reaching the top of the hill I was out
                    of danger and I took it more leisurely. At the foot of the hill on the bank of a
                    creek the wounded had been collected among whom were Lieuts. J. B. Milam,
                    Cardwell Wilson and Rushing and many others. Going on further I reached the
                    Field Hospital established in a residence. Here I saw Capt. Jno. T. Grion of Co
                    2 with a ball in his side waiting for it to be extracted. I showed my wound to a
                    surgeon who said, &quot;you had as well go on, there are too many here wounded
                    worse than you are, for us to take time to dress your wound, keep it well
                    saturated with cold water to keep down fever.&quot; I filled my canteen at a
                    creek close by, and started on towards Harrodsburg. Beyond the town of
                    Perryville, night coming on I climbed the fence into a blue-grass pasture, and
                    wrapping myself in my blanket, lay down under the trees and slept till morning,
                    when I found the army retreating towards Harrodsburg, and I joined them, finding
                    the command at our old camp there.</p>
            <p>On the next morning we commenced our retreat to Knoxville. The sick and slightly
                    wounded were distributed in the wagons and ambulances. Dock Newport who was
                    sick, and myself were placed in the medical wagon of the regt. driven by
                    LaFayette Cherry, and for two days we had a fine time, but when the wagon was
                    needed to haul supplies and we were put afoot, and walked to Knoxville,
                    Tenn.</p>
            <p>The command came up and after a day or so in camp in the snow without tents I was
                    sent to the hospital at Chattanooga, and put in the last house on the East side
                    of Market St. next the River, and on October 30th furloughed for 60 days.</p>
            <p>I stopped to see the regt. at Tullahoma, where I had to take it afoot, the train
                    running no further. A few miles out I bought a mule which was gentle, but so
                    fidgetty that I could not get on him without his being held, on account of my
                    wounded arm. Finding no way to cross the Tennessee River without swimming the
                    mule, I left him, crossed in a row boat and walked home with some of the
                    officers of the 46th Tenn. who had a recruiting camp at Blue Creek Church in
                    Humphreys Co. and for fear of the yanks who nominally held the Country, I made
                    my way through the woods mostly, home, taking them all by surprise.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="0012_000244_000203_0019.jpg" xml:id="d3e624"/>
            <p>17</p>
            <p>I enjoyed my furlough at home and visiting my sweetheart as well as could be
                    under the circumstances. The proximity of the Federals at Fort Heiman,
                    necessitated being very careful to avoid capture, and I travelled mostly at
                    night. Found the country badly torn up, having been raided by detachments from
                    both armies, and also filled with guerrillas who rode from place to place and
                    robbed, maltreated and murdered those who were supposed to have any money or
                    valuables.</p>
            <p>My Mother hastily made a suit of clothes, and I took my surplus baggage over to
                    Blue Creek, and returned to finish out my furlough unencumbered. I spent the
                    last night at Eld. Asa Cox&apos;s and started afoot about 3 A. M. and took the
                    road to the Mem. and Ohio R. R. near Paris and then followed the R. R. track.
                    Near Curriers Factory I saw many fires ahead, and fearing I was approaching a
                    Federal Cavalry Camp, I advanced very cautously, and was glad to find it only
                    log-piles in a new clearing. About Porter&apos;s Mill daylight appeared. I
                    stopped at Mr. John Toombs&apos; for breakfast, and was told by him that Federal
                    gunboats had gone up Tennessee River to try to intercept Gen. Forest&apos;s raid
                    into West-Tenn and that a column of Cavalry had gone up parallel with the river
                    to scout. Knowing that there was a nest of Union men at Rocky Point near Big
                    Sandy, I left the R. R. as soon as T crossed Big Sandy, and took the woods
                    striking a bee line for a point on Sugar Creek where I knew I would find
                    friends. Where I crossed the road to Point Mason a settler told me that a couple
                    of Federals had passed that morning on their way to communicate with the
                    Gunboats at Point Mason. I hurried on to the woods, and came out at the proper
                    point on Sugar Creek, and spent the night at a friend&apos;s, whose name I have
                    forgotten. During the night I could hear the whistles of the Federal Gunboats on
                    the river. I crossed the Tennessee River in a rowboat at Davison&apos;s Ferry
                    and learned of the gunboats having gone up. I reached Mr. Mattlew Garret&apos;s
                    on Little Blue Creek, where I boarded. I learned here that his brother Capt
                    Garrett, had raised a company of Artillery, and that they would start to
                    Murfreesboro in a day or two, and I waited and went with them. They were a rough
                    but jolly and kind set.</p>
            <p>On the night of Dec. 31st, we had reached a point near enough to hear next day,
                    Jan. 1st, 1863, the roar of artillery at the battle of Murfreesboro. Reached
                    Murfreesboro about noon, of the 2nd and stopped at the camp of the cooking
                    detail, and waited till night intending to go with them to the regt. on night of
                    the 3rd, but they recieved orders before night to move to the rear, just before
                    daylight of the 4th, the regt, came along, and stopped long enough to get their
                    rations. The next evening we bivouacked 5 miles N. of Shelbyville. The boys say
                    that it was a hard fought battle. Only one of the Co. was killed, (Link
                    Ballard.)</p>
            <p>The regt has been temporarily consolidated with the 4th Tenn., and Co&apos;s D
                    and I consolidated. Capt. J. T. Kendall and Lieut. B. F. Peeples of Co. I being
                    the officers. </p>
            <p>We went into winter quarters at Shelbyville. On Feb. 2nd the Brigade consisting
                    of 4th and 5th, 19th, 24th, 31st and 33rd Tenn. and 45th Alabama were ordered on
                    Outpost duty at Guy&apos;s Gap 10 miles from S. on Murfreesboro Pike where we
                    remained on Outpost duty till June 27th. Here we had the most pleasant time of
                    the war, plenty of room for camps, without crowding, good water, and a good
                    foraging country, where could buy, milk, eggs, chickens, butter, vegetables and
                    etc. After the spring opened we drilled</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="0012_000244_000203_0020.jpg" xml:id="d3e640"/>
            <p>18</p>
            <p>regularly, and learned for the first time Brigade Drill. A large bush arbor was
                    erected and revival services held. A great many professed religion, and many
                    were baptized, some by immersion, some by sprinkling, and some by pouring, and I
                    witnessed all three modes at one time. We had Bible classes, singing classes and
                    many other exercises.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 13</p>
            <p>THE CHICAMAUGA CAMPAIGN</p>
            <p>On June 27th Gen. Rosencrans having recruited from the effects of the Battle of
                    Murfreesboro, advanced and we retreated first to Tullahoma, then across the
                    Tennessee River, and we then to Chattanooga, followed closely by the Federal
                    army. We Tennesseans especially regretted the abandonment of Middle Tenn. which
                    is truly a garden spot. The roads were very muddy caused by almost continual
                    rains, and the weather very warm.</p>
            <p>We reached Chattanooga July 7th and from then till Sept. 7th we worked almost
                    daily on the fortifications, and on the 8th moved south to met Rosencrans who
                    had crossed Lookout Mt. into McLemore&apos;s Cove. From then till Sept. 17th we
                    manoevered about LaFayette, Crawfish Springs, and Lee and Gordon&apos;s Mills,
                    and on Sept. 18th and 19th fought the bloody battle of Chickamauga. We crossed
                    Chickamauga Creek early on the morning of the 19th, about a mile below Lee and
                    Gordon&apos;s Mill, and double-quicked to the front, soon passing Hood&apos;s
                    Division of Longstreet&apos;s Corps from Va. and then learned for certain that
                    we had reenforcements, being told that the other two divisions, Pickett&apos;s
                    and McLaws, were at Ringgold or Tunnell Hill, this buoyed up our courage, and we
                    gave a prolonged cheer. We soon deployed into line of battle and advanced, stray
                    shell and minnie balls flying over, one minnie ball wounding Private Dick Coly
                    of Co. E. After halting in the woods, we were soon advanced across the old field
                    in front, under fire. On the other side we saw stragglers, and Gen. Preston
                    Smith cautioned us not to fire on his men, who were in front of us. Without
                    firing we were ordered back in the woods, still under fire. Alexander of Co. A.,
                    Allen and Hagler of Co. F. and Wilson of our Co. D. were wounded, and Lieut.
                    Webber of the 4th Regt. killed. We were again ordered forward in the field,
                    under fire, and again moved back to the woods without an opportunity to fire
                    which we regretted very much. While lying down here a shell struck the ground in
                    front of us and richoceted, and it seemed to be coming straight to me, but it
                    struck to one side, it struck Private Gid Comer of Co. I and crushed his hip,
                    and lower part of his body, and rolling off on the arm of Private J. W. Pillow
                    of Co. D. deadened it and bloodied him very badly. Comer soon died from his
                    wound but Pillow after running back to a tree, and taking a good look at his
                    arm, found it was alright and soon returned to his place.</p>
            <p>(The above incident occurred next day and was recorded here incorrectly)</p>
            <p>We lay here till sundown, when heavy firing commenced and we were moved up to the
                    edge of the field and Maney&apos;s and Churchill&apos;s Brigades moved to the
                    right, the firing continued till about dark, when the enemy was repulsed, but
                    the brave Gen. Preston Smith was killed. I had not been under fire since the
                    Battle of Perryville,</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="0012_000244_000203_0021.jpg" xml:id="d3e660"/>
            <p>19</p>
            <p>nearly a year, and having dreamed the night before that I was killed, I expected
                    that I would be much more frightened, but after a few minutes the old battle
                    feeling came back, and I had but little fear. The regiment and the troops
                    generally, most of whom had not been in battle since the Battle of Murfreesboro,
                    behaved splendidly. For awhile on the morning of the 20th, everything was quiet
                    but the firing soon began right and left, and soon became general, and shells
                    began to fly over thick and fast, some falling short, some going over. (Here it
                    was that Gid Comer was mortally wounded, instead of as already written.) We lay
                    there an hour or so under heavy shelling, the regiment standing it nobly,
                    remaining in line all the time. The enemy was driven back and we moved to the
                    front and right, and were shelled again. Late in the evening we were moved
                    forward, and Gen. Cheatham taking command of Wright&apos;s Brigade, and giving
                    the commands himself, I expected we would experience heavy fighting, but instead
                    Wright&apos;s Brigade moved on, and we were halted. The fighting lasted but a
                    short while. Longstreet pressed them closely on the left, and when under the
                    combined attack they gave way, and broke toward Chattanooga, leaving their
                    breastworks with their artillery, and many prisoners behind. A glorious shout
                    went up along the whole line, announcing the victory. Several Generals, Polk,
                    Cheatham, and two or three brigadiers collected in front of us, and listened
                    intently, Gen. Polk especially seemed to enjoy it extremely. While the fighting
                    was going on, we moved up a little, and I have never seen troops manouvere
                    better in the woods. When silence at last reigned over the battlefield, we laid
                    ourselves down to sleep, and slept soundly among the dead, cold as it was. We
                    suffered much for want of water, as it had to be brought from Chicamauga Creek,
                    2 or 3 miles away. Lieut. Col. Luke W. Finley arrived late in the evening and
                    was assigned to duty as Lt. Col. of 4th and 5th Regiments. All who were armed
                    still with the old muskets picked up Enfield Rifles from the battlefield. When
                    we awaked next morning everything was white with frost, the dead and all. When
                    we formed line and moved off the row of stacked muskets left showed where the
                    regiment had formed, and henceforth only rifles were used. Moved up to the foot
                    of Missionary Ridge, and halted there most of the day, for Maney&apos;s Brigade
                    to drive them from the top of the Ridge, and for the Cavalry to cross and clear
                    the way at the foot. Halting awhile near the top, I took a look, but could see
                    only a great dust around Chattanooga, and over the river, and what looked like a
                    pontoon, with wagons. Those with field glasses said there were three pontoons,
                    with wagons crossing, and Cavalry fording. We moved into Chattanooga Valley, and
                    formed line of battle. There was some skirmishing by the Cavalry but no serious
                    fighting. The result of the Battle of Chicamauga was 7,000 prisoners, 30,000
                    stand of small arms, and 37 pieces of artillery were captured. Gen. Polk was
                    relieved of the command of the Corps, because Gen. Bragg did not like his
                    management during the campaign.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 14</p>
            <p>THE MISSIONARY RIDGE CAMPAIGN</p>
            <p>We encompassed Chattanooga with a line of intrenchments reaching from the
                    Tennessee River near the northern extremity of Missionary Ridge across the
                    valley to Lookout Mountain, thus cut-</p>

            <p>20</p>
            <p>ting off all communication of the enemy with his base by rail, and forcing him to
                    haul all his supplies by wagon across the Cumberland Mountains, and
                    Walden&apos;s Ridge, putting them on short rations.</p>
            <p>On the morning of Oct. 10th we were called into line, along the breastworks to
                    recieve President Jefferson Davis who rode along the lines with Gen. Bragg and
                    staff, and I had a good look at him. Found him better looking than I expected he
                    was, from his pictures. Cheers went up all along the line as he passed.</p>
            <p>In the evening of the same day, an election was held in Co. &quot;D&quot; by
                    order of Col. J. J. Lamb to fill the vacancy of 2nd Lieut. made by the
                    cashiering of Lieut. J. M. Elliot for inefficiency. On first ballot J. D. Wilson
                    recieved 3 votes, J. W. Pillow 6 and myself 8. No choice. On second ballot J. W.
                    Pillow recieved 8 and myself 10. So I was elected, and on the 12th examined by
                    the Examining Board consisting of Col. Walker of the 19th Regt. Press. and Col.
                    Wilson of the 24th, and Col. J. J. Lamb of the 5th. I answered all of Col.
                    Walker&apos;s questions (but one), and he passed me with the compliment &quot;I
                    find him bright in everything I examined him on.&quot; Col. Wilson only asks me
                    two questions, which I answered. Col. Lamb declined to ask any. Lts. J. L.
                    Lemonds and G. H. Wynns, of Co. I and G. W. Crawford of Co. E. were also
                    examined. On the 13th many of us accompanied the 1st Tenn. Band to Gen.
                    Bragg&apos;s headquarters to serenade the President. He made a short speech in
                    which he eulogized Tenn. soldiers. Gen&apos;s. Bragg and Pemberton also said a
                    few words.</p>
            <p>On Oct. 14th Capt. Joe T. Kendall returned from Henry Co. and was ordered to take
                    command of Co&apos;s &quot;D&quot; and &quot;I&quot;. He was much chargrined
                    that his Co. D did not elect me unanimously for Lieut. saying that I was the
                    only man in the Co. fit to make an officer of, and that had any one else been
                    elected he would have ordered me before the Board anyhow.</p>
            <p>On October 19th an order was read confirming, Maj. B. B. Bunch, and Lieuts. J. L.
                    Lemonds, G. W. Crawford, G. H. Wynns and myself. (Lieuts. N. C. Howard and Joe
                    Jordan were also confirmed about that time). The officers of Co!s &quot;D&quot; and &quot;I&quot;, now are J. T. Kendall, Capt., J. L. Lemonds 1st.
                    Lieut. and G. H. Wynns, and myself 2nd Lieuts. Capt. B. F. Peeples, and J. W.
                    Howard were relieved and ordered to report to Gen. Strahl, our brigadier
                    general. Kept our position in the trenches in front of Chattanooga till Oct.
                    24th. Suffering much on picket, in the cold rains that prevailed. Felt very
                    awkward without a gun, and with only a sword.</p>
            <p>On the 25th we took train to Charleston, Tenn. and crossed the Hiwassee on a
                    pontoon bridge made of two planks laid side by side on rafts of old logs
                    fastened to a rope stretched across the River. Crossing by moonlight, we marched
                    to Sweetwater, and remained several days drilling. It was a great relief to get
                    away from the line of battle, and we had a chance to do some foraging, and
                    secure some change of diet. The rations being short, and unwholesome. Only
                    Cheatham&apos;s and Stevenson&apos;s Divisions were there. On the 6th of Nov. we
                    were relieved by Longstreet&apos;s Corps, and took train back to Etowah. The
                    crossties of the R. R. were so rotten that the train ran off, and smashed some
                    of the cars, and slightly injured some of the men. We walked back to our old
                    lines in front of Chattanooga.</p>
            <p>It being impossible to obtain clothing by purchase, as no town was near, and as I
                    could not draw clothing from the Quarter-</p>

            <p>master&apos;s Department, as an officer, I obtained a 5 day leave of absence, to
                    go to Atlanta, to purchase some, and on Nov. 22nd took the train to that city.
                    Found everything extremely high. Paid $3.00 for a meal at the Trout House, and
                    $8.00 per day board at Mrs Hoyle&apos;s on Peach Tree Street. Was enabled to
                    secure but an indifferent outfit, for the winter with the small means at my
                    command.</p>
            <p>The Battle of Missionary Ridge was fought on Nov. 25th and on my return I met the
                    demorialized Army at Dalton on the morning of the 27th. I had never seen a
                    defeated army before, and it was a sad scene. Eight companies of the regiment (G
                    and K) being detached, were engaged, 119 strong (or weak) 60 of these were
                    either killed, wounded or captured. Capt. J. T. Kendall was wounded, and died of
                    a surgical operation. Lt. G. H. Wynns was captured, and only Lt. J. T. Lemonds
                    was with the Co.</p>
            <p>Cheatham&apos;s Division which was composed entirely of Tennesseeans had been
                    broken up by exchanges of brigades with other divisions and ours (Strahl&apos;s)
                    was put into Stewart&apos;s Division before the battle of Missionary Ridge and
                    fought with it during the battle. This created much discontent as C. Div. prided
                    itself on being the crack division of the army. The exchange of commands by
                    bringing troops and subordinate officers into contact with strange officers
                    created confusion and no doubt added to the disaster at Missionary Ridge.</p>
            <p>On going into camp at Dalton, Lt. Lemonds asked me if he had better have Capt. B.
                    F. Peeples, and Lt. J. W. Howard ordered back to the command, and I answered
                    yes. And it was soon afterwards done.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 15</p>
            <p>WINTER OF 1863 &amp; 4</p>
            <p>At the close of the Mission Ridge campaign we went into winter quarters around
                    Dalton. Our Division (Stewart&apos;s) camping on side of Rocky Face Ridge, a
                    mile or so N. W. of the town.</p>
            <p>In December, Adjt. Kendall was detailed to go to Mobile for blank books for the
                    regiment and other commands, and at his request I was detailed by Col. Lamb to
                    act as Adjt. till his return, about ten days. I felt it a compliment as I was
                    about the youngest Lieut. in the regt. Being young and timid I dreaded the
                    ordeal of Dress Parade, but summoned courage to go through it very well. Col.
                    Lamb said as if I had been at it all my life.</p>
            <p>Cabins were built and we made ourselves pretty comfortable.</p>
            <p>On January 1st, 1864, the 4th and 5th regiments were detailed to do provost guard
                    duty in the town of Dalton, and as it was the coldest weather that we
                    experienced during the war, we suffered very much. Were quartered in an
                    unfinished hotel without door shutters, or window glass or shutters. An order
                    having been issued that one man in every ten, of the non-commissioned officers
                    and privates, and one officer in each company should be furloughed. I succeeded
                    in getting a furlough for 25 days, and as West Tenn. was just then in the hands
                    of the Federals, I went to Virginia to visit my birthplace and relatives. Was
                    accompanied by my particular friend Lt. N. C. Howard. We started on afternoon of
                    Jan. 14 and found the trains crowded with soldiers, mostly Longstreet&apos;s men
                    who had been left in hospitals when his command returned to Va.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="0012_000244_000203_0024.jpg" xml:id="d3e722"/>
            <p>22</p>
            <p>We stopped a day in Wilmington, N. C. to let the crowd get ahead of us, and spent
                    a night in the City of Richmond, &quot;Capital of the Confederate States.&quot; Monticello Hall where we put up was filthy and crowded.</p>
            <p>Reached Frederick&apos;s Hall Depot, Louisa Co. at 11 A. M. and walked out 1 1/2
                    miles N. W. to Locust Green and was warmly welcomed by Uncle William Rennolds
                    and Aunt Barbara, and enjoyed the time from Jan. 19th to Feb. 2nd as well as we
                    could under the circumstances.</p>
            <p>I went to Staunton on the train to visit Uncle Taliaferro, my father&apos;s
                    oldest brother. Found him dangerously sick. Remained with him two days,
                    telegraphing his condition to Uncle William, and he came on the second day, and
                    the next, Jan. 25th I returned to Uncle Williams, as I did not want to leave Lt.
                    Howard, without any one to keep him company.</p>
            <p>A telegram from Uncle William on the 29th said that Uncle Taliaferro was dead. I
                    had the wagon hitched up, and went with the driver to the Depot, and met Uncle
                    W. with the corpse, and next day the burial took place in the family burial
                    ground. Only two persons outside of the family and slaves were present, vig.
                    Messts. Tally and Bibb. Such is war. Aunt Barbara was confined to the house with
                    a young baby. Uncle T. was a successful physician, and a man of great firmness,
                    and good judgement. He had never married and made no pretensions to religion.
                    Had accumulated good property but it was sold for Confederate money and in one
                    way and another squandered.</p>
            <p>I enjoyed seeing my birthplace, and the scenes of my fathers early life, and of
                    his early married life, and could readily recognize many places that I had heard
                    described.</p>
            <p>On Feb. 2nd we bade farewell to them all and started back to the army. Spent the
                    night in Richmond and also next day. Saw the Confederate Congress in session,
                    and heard a few speeches, but both house soon went into secret session and we
                    were hustled out. Walked about the City, and visited places of interest. The
                    City was full of officers on leave of absence and etc. They were well dressed
                    and presented gay figures. Much better dressed than officers of the Western
                    Army. We had to obtain passes from Military governor, or Commander of the Post,
                    and show it on almost every corner where we met the Provost Guard, which made it
                    very unpleasant.</p>
            <p>Took train about sundown, and at 4 A. M. on the 7th reached Dalton, and was glad
                    to get back, to the command again. Had a very tiresome trip. Railroads very
                    rough, and train ran off once.</p>
            <p>On Feb. 9th was appointed as Judge Advocate of a Court Martial to try Private B.
                    A. Haguewood for Desertion. Lts. J. P. Tyler, J. L. Lemonds and Frank Clark,
                    composed the Court. He plead guilty of &quot;Absence without Leave.&quot;
                    Never having been in a Civil Courtroom in my life, and only once in a Court
                    martial as witness, I felt awkward as a prosecuting officer, but there was but
                    little to do.</p>
            <p>On the 11th Cheatham&apos;s Tennessee division was reformed and all concerned
                    were overjoyed. I was on duty that day, and was left in the old camp with a
                    guard in charge of baggage till 3 P. M. when it was all removed.</p>
            <p>Found that Lt. Howard, Sergt. J. M. Coffman and Private T. G. Morris had formed a
                    new &quot; Mess &quot; giving myself a place in it. Our quarters were not as
                    good as the ones we left.</p>
            <p>On Feb. 20th Cheatham&apos;s Division was ordered to go to Demop-</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="0012_000244_000203_0025.jpg" xml:id="d3e751"/>
            <p>23</p>
            <p>olis, Ala. to reenforce Gen. Leonidas Polk who was being driven back by
                    Grant.</p>
            <p>We left the ground hard frozen at Dalton, and found the fields in Ala. full of
                    negro plowmen turning over the soil, and preparing to plant. At every depot and
                    cross-roads people were gathered to see us pass, and the &quot;Boys&quot; had
                    a gay time sending their cards (or rather slips of paper with their names and
                    command written on them) to the girls , and recieving theirs in return.</p>
            <p>We reached Demopolis only to find that Grant had fallen back, and we retraced our
                    steps, or rather took the train back to our old camp at Dalton.</p>
            <p>I was on duty as lieutenant of the guard on the day we left Dalton, and I had the
                    pleasure of releasing from the stocks a private who had been courtmartialed, and
                    sentenced to the stocks for two hours each day, I think for thirty days,
                    probably for desertion. I rebelled in heart when it became my duty to put him in
                    the cruel frame, and when ordered to release him and send him back to his
                    command I took out the pins and threw them as far as I could send them. The man
                    belonged to some regiment from Ga. or Ala. which camp was enclosed in the same
                    guard line as ours.</p>
            <p>Gen. Joe. E. Johnston who has succeeded Gen. Braxton Bragg in the command of the
                    Army of Tennessee, soon after the Battle of Missionary Ridge, spent the winter
                    in thoroghly preparing for the coming campaign, and when it opened the army had
                    better discipline, equipment, and morale than it had at any time during its
                    existence and followed its leader through the campaign of 1864, relying fully on
                    his ability to lead them, and asked no questions.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 16</p>
            <p>CAMPAIGN OF 1864. RESACA AND NEW HOPE CHURCH</p>
            <p>The summer of 1864 witnessed the most eventful scene through which the Army of
                    Tennessee passed during the Civil War.</p>
            <p>During the latter part of April we commenced to throw up a line of fortifications
                    N. and W. of Dalton, mainly along the crest of Rocky Face Ridge, and on May 7th,
                    Gen. Sherman advanced from Chattanooga, and began the campaign, and we broke
                    camp and moved to the front.</p>
            <p>On the evening of the 8th we moved by a roundabout way, ten miles to the left to
                    support an attack on Dug Gap. The forced march exhausted most of us as it was at
                    the end of a winter of camp life and we were disqualified for such a hard march.
                    We found that the Ky. Cavalry had repulsed the enemy. We spent most of the night
                    fortifying the position. After skirmishing till May 12th, we moved down to
                    Resaca, the enemy having crossed Rocky Face Ridge at Snake Creek Gap, and
                    menaced our Railroad to Atlanta.</p>
            <p>On the evening of the 13th we moved out in line of battle with 4th Tenn. as
                    skirmishers. We met the enemy who were posted on the west side of a creek
                    bottom, the narrow valley being cleared. As we came over the ridge we were met
                    by a galling fire, and two men were killed and twenty wounded in a few minutes.
                    Lts. Andrews and Sidebottom among the latter.</p>
            <p>Private A. D. Beckwith of our Co. (D) who had been a very wicked youth, but had
                    been converted during a revival in camp about a month before, was sitting
                    against a small hickory tree and was struck in the body by a minnie ball. He
                    dropped his rifle,</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="0012_000244_000203_0026.jpg" xml:id="d3e782"/>
            <p>24</p>
            <p>and commenced clapping his hands, dying in less than a minute. It gave me a
                    higher conception of the power of religion to stay a dying man than anything I
                    have ever seen.</p>
            <p>The line of battle at the point where we were posted was on the side of a pretty
                    steep ridge, and in full view of the enemy, and as we remained stationary it
                    required a good deal of nerve to endure the galling fire to which we were
                    exposed. After a few rounds the heavy firing ceased and all settled down behind
                    such trees of logs as were to be found, and endured the fire as best they could
                    till night. Being the first engagement I had been in without a gun in my hands,
                    I found it harder than usual to keep my courage up. Being only a subordinate,
                    and only required to repeat commands, I had nothing to do but think of the
                    danger, without the loading and firing to occupy my mind.</p>
            <p>We spent the following night preparing intrenchments, half of the command working
                    till midnight, and the other half, from mid-night till morning, by which time we
                    were very well fortified.</p>
            <p>Just before daylight on the morning of the 14th I was put in command of the
                    detail for the day&apos;s picket duty, from the regiment, and we relieved the
                    pickets at the foot of the hill, and near the edge of the bottom field. The
                    preceding picket detail had fortified their position as best they could, by
                    piling up rails, logs and etc, between the trees and stumps.</p>
            <p>Four men were posted in a group together, the groups being about 20 paces apart.
                    I took up my station with the centre group, and prepared for a hot day of it.
                    The fortified line of battle of the enemy could be seen on the low ridge across
                    the narrow valley, though bushes obscured some parts of it. The pickets or line
                    of skirmishers were posted behind trees near the edge of the valley. Desultory
                    firing was kept up on both sides all day. About 9 A. M. I heard the bugle of the
                    enemy sound &quot;the Advance,&quot; and I called to the men to &quot;look
                    out they are coming, give it to them heavy.&quot; The skirmishers started at a
                    double-quick, across the field, and were met by a heavy fire both from our
                    picket line, and also our line of battle, which fired over our heads, with what
                    effect I did not discover. I soon saw that the object was to get possession of a
                    ditch which ran diagonally across or obliquely across the valley. This was hid
                    by a heavy growth of bushes and saplings and completely hid the enemy&apos;s
                    skirmishers, and enabled them to act as sharpshooters. The change of position
                    also enabled them to enfilade our slender protection, and they compelled us to
                    crouch behind our works for protection, and our cramped position caused us to
                    long for relief.</p>
            <p>About noon the men asked me to go up to the line of battle, and ask Col. Lamb to
                    send a new detail to relieve us. Knowing that it was unusual to change pickets
                    except at dawn and dark, and that Col. Lamb did not like to risk acting in such
                    matters without orders from his superior officers, I hesitated but the men urged
                    it so earnestly that I determined to make the effort, even though I might render
                    myself liable to charges for overstepping my authority and also for being absent
                    from my post of duty. I put the serjeant in charge of the pickets. I slipped
                    quietly along through the thickest bushes to the line of works, and finding Col.
                    Lamb, I asked that we be relieved. He said that he was afraid that he would be
                    blamed, if any of the men should be killed or wounded. I urged the fact that the
                    men were suffering very much in their cramped and exposed position, and then</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="0012_000244_000203_0027.jpg" xml:id="d3e800"/>
            <p>25</p>
            <p>hurried back to my post. A little later I heard a noise in the bushes behind us,
                    and saw that a detail had been deployed, and were coming down the hill to our
                    relief. They drew the fire of the enemy whenever any of them came in view in
                    open places, but no causalties occurred. I called to my men in as low a tone as
                    could be heard, to quietly and one at a time make their way back to the works,
                    and when all were gone, I followed and left the lieutenant of the new detail in
                    charge. All of us reached the works safely, and I enjoyed stretching my limbs in
                    the trenches where there was more room.</p>
            <p>We spent the night by details strengthening our fortifications. Skirmishing
                    continued all day of the 15th, very heavy firing to our right during part of the
                    day. The enemy threw a pontoon bridge across the Estanaula River to our left,
                    and moved over part of their army, and threatened our R. R. communications, and
                    at 10 o&apos;clock at night we were withdrawn to the town, and while waiting for
                    other commands to cross the bridges, we heard heavy firing by our pickets and
                    some confusion ensued, but it soon quieted down and the crossing was made
                    safely. We marched most of the night and of the next day, and bivouacked near
                    Calhoun.</p>
            <p>On the 17th we continued our retreat slowly through Adairsville and Kingston,
                    marching or being kept up most of the night as well as dsy, and by this time we
                    were very much worn down. On the 19th we formed line of battle 3 miles South of
                    Kingston, and every preparation made for and engagement, but at 3 P. M. we moved
                    back (in full view of the enemy,) in column by company, 3 miles to a low ridge
                    near Cassville. Gen. Johnston in his report of the campaign says, that it was
                    his intention to give the enemy battle near Kingston, and try to crush one wing
                    of Sherman&apos;s Army, before the other which was moving on a different road,
                    could come up. But some scouts reported that a force of the enemy was advancing
                    by a road which would have brought them in his rear. After the retiring movement
                    was too far advanced to be reversed, this report was found to be an error, as
                    the troops seen were some of our own cavalry coming in from our right flank. The
                    5th regiment was thrown out as skirmishers, and though the enemy followed our
                    movement, it was, too late for them to attack, the regt. remained on the outpost
                    as pickets till morning of the 20th.</p>
            <p>During the night of the 19th, a line of rifle-pits were constructed on the low
                    ridge, and we fully expected to wait the enemys attack next day. But early in
                    the night Gen. Johnston called his Corps commanders, Polk, Hardee and Hood in
                    consultation. One was in favor of holding the position, but the other two
                    declared that they could not maintain it for two hours, and Gen. J. reluctantly
                    decided to withdraw, and about daylight the movement began, the army moving in 4
                    or 5 parallel columns. At daylight we were called in from the picket line and
                    followed, overtaking the Brigade at Cartersville.</p>
            <p>We waited at Etowah River several hours for the wagons to cross. We then crossed
                    and after marching two miles further we bivouacked, and having slept none the
                    night before, I was soon asleep, and continueing almost continuously till next
                    morning.</p>
            <p>The enemy having ceased pursuit, we spent the 21st, 22nd and 23rd quietly in
                    bivouac, and the rest was timely and fully enjoyed. There was preaching on the
                    23rd by our Capt. (B. F. Peeples.) How strange it seemed to be beyond the sound
                    of musketry, and enjoy the quiet of the Sabbath, and to those who were
                    christians, to</p>

            <p>26</p>
            <p>hear the soothing sound of the Gospel. Lt. J. W. Howard arrived from Tenn. on the
                    23rd, bringing me letters from home and from my sweetheart, and what was no less
                    welcome, some much needed clothing.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 24th, the enemy&apos;s movements necessitated our resuming
                    an active campaign. They had crossed the Etowah River and advanced to New Hope
                    Church where their advance was checked by Stewart&apos;s Division after a sharp
                    engagement.</p>
            <p>From the 24th to the 28th we marched and countermarched around New Hope Church.
                    On the latter day we took position not far from Dallas, and fortified. As
                    Co&apos;s A and C had only one officer able or present for duty (Lt. Linderman)
                    I was ordered to report temporarily to him for duty with that company, and
                    remained with it for several days.</p>
            <p>The 5th regiment having been thrown out as skirmishers, we remained as pickets,
                    and at night the line was fortified by digging picket-holes, large enough to
                    contain the four men forming a group, which were about 20 paces apart, and this
                    mode was kept up ever afterwards by the picket line. Instead of being relieved
                    at night as usual, the whole line of the battle was moved towards New Hope
                    Church to the right, as the enemy was moving in that direction in order to get
                    possession of the W. and A. R. R. So for the two next days, we held the position
                    with only a skirmish line, supported by Lewis&apos; Brigade of Kentuckians held
                    in reserve. Col. J. J. Lamb was in command of the skirmish line of the Division
                    (Cheatham&apos;s) and Gen. Bate (W. B.) in command of the line occupied by the
                    picket of the skirmish line left to hold the ground occupied by the Corps
                    (Hardee&apos;s) Lt. J. L. Lemonds acted as Adjt. for Col. Lamb.</p>
            <p>During the skirmishing on the 28th Sergt. Frazier was killed and Privates Geo
                    Poyner, B. A. Haguewood and Thornton wounded, and Lt. Col. Luke Finley of the
                    4th was wounded.</p>
            <p>About 5 P. M. of the 29th Gen. Bate ordered an advance in order to determine the
                    strength of the enemy. The signal was to be a cannon fired in front of Gen.
                    Lewis&apos; line on our left. Col. Lamb on recieving the order sent Lt. Lemonds
                    to communicate it to the officers on his line, and Lt. Linderman who was at Col.
                    Lamb&apos;s headquarters, started to his company, but did not reach it till the
                    firing was over. Lt. Lemonds had proceeded but a little way on his rounds when
                    by some mistake the signal was given too soon, and on Lewis&apos; Brigade
                    advancing, They were met by a withering fire, and the enemy thinking it an
                    attack along the whole line opened a heavy fire. I was lying behind a small
                    ridge a few steps in rear of the picket line, and near its center where it could
                    be easiest controlled. A few of the men who had been allowed to leave the
                    picket-holes in order to stretch their limbs and rest, were ordered by me to
                    return quickly to their posts, and I called to the men to give the enemy a heavy
                    fire, and warm reception if they advanced. A masked battery nearly in front of
                    us filled the air with grape and canister, while minnie balls flew thick as
                    hail. It only lasted a few minutes. Lewis&apos; Brigade being recalled and the
                    enemy finding it was not a general attack.</p>
            <p>About the time the firing ceased, I noticed that the men on the left of the
                    company had left their posts and were slowly falling back, and I asked what it
                    meant, and recieved in reply, &quot;the company to our left has fallen back to
                    the works.&quot; I said to them, &quot;only swing back on the left, but keep
                    your communication with the right,&quot; which still held its position.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="0012_000244_000203_0029.jpg" xml:id="d3e838"/>
            <p>27</p>
            <p>In a few minutes Col. Lamb ordered the pickets from the works to return to the
                    picket line, and when those of the left of Co&apos;s A and C who had left their
                    posts saw the line being reestablished they promptly returned to their
                    positions. Col. Lamb came along to personally inspect the line. When he reached
                    the picket post nearly in front of me, one of the men called his attention to a
                    United States flag in view of the enemy&apos;s works. He stopped a moment to
                    look, when a Federal picket who was standing by a tall stump or broken tree
                    caught sight of him and fired at him, the ball striking him in the abdomen, and
                    he fell mortally wounded. The man who fired was in plain view of me, I saw the
                    smoke rise, heard the crack of his rifle, and heard him say &quot;I hit him.&quot; Some one called for the Infirmary Corps, and as they came in sight
                    through an opening in the bushes they were fired on, and James Rainey killed and
                    Joe Daniel wounded in the foot. It seemed for a few moments as if it would be
                    the next to impossible to get him safely away. But with the help of some of the
                    pickets, he was placed on the litter, and by taking a route which avoided the
                    open places they carried him away safely. He died next day.</p>
            <p>The skirmishing was kept up most of the time next day (30th) sometimes quite
                    heavy. Private Herron of Co. C was killed, no others hurt. We were relieved at
                    night by the 16th S. C. and at 9 P. M. we started to the Brigade 4 miles away
                    and near New Hope Church. Getting away from the sound of the guns, we marched
                    along in the moonlight, scarcely saying a word till the silence became almost
                    painful. But I was constrained to say that &quot;I was not like Juan
                    Fernandez-----</p>
            <p>O, solitude where are the charms, That sages have seen in thy face ? Better dwell
                    in the midst of alarms, Than reign in this horrible place.</p>
            <p>I was glad to be out of the alarms, for my part. And others unhesitatingly
                    endorsed it.</p>
            <p>Found Maj. Hampton in command of the 4th and 5th Tenn.</p>
            <p>From May 31st to June 18th was occupied in continual marching, skirmishing,
                    fortifying and etc. We gradually extended our line to the right, across the W.
                    and A. R. R. and near Pine Mountain and Lost Mountains, and then swung back our
                    left, and finally retired to the Kennesaw Mountain line, which reached the full
                    length of the Mountains, and far to the right and left.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 17</p>
            <p>BATTLE OF KENNESAW MOUNTAIN</p>
            <p>From the 19th to the 27th of June we built fortifications and were sometimes in
                    reserve, where we fortified also. Skirmishing was heavy, and the enemy pressed
                    forward towards our fortified line. On the 22nd I was on picket in charge of the
                    regimental detail, with Capt. A. W. Caldwell in command of the Brigade detail.
                    He was wounded slightly. The enemy made a heavy attack on the picket line on our
                    right, and drove them back, which compelled us to retire about 200 yards. We
                    were relieved at dark.</p>
            <p>Next day 23rd about 5 P. M. a heavy cannonade was opened on the works of
                    Maney&apos;s Division, which continued about an hour, when the enemy charged the
                    picket line, and drove it into the breast-</p>

            <p>works. The 1st and 27th Tenn. was ordered to dislodge them, they made a gallant
                    charge from the works, and drove back the enemy, capturing 20 or 30 prisoners,
                    and many guns, spades and picks. The 4th and 5th moved up to the salient,
                    afterwards known as the &quot;Dead Angle,&quot; to strengthen the line. On the
                    24th we moved back to our reserve position, a hundre yards or so in rear of the
                    &quot;Dead Angle,&quot; in the evening of the 26th, still further to the rear
                    and across a muddy creek bottom where we were held to repel any attempt to break
                    through our lines which terminated at the foot of the hills on each side of the
                    Creek. There was but little fighting on the 24th, 25th and 26th of June, but it
                    was only the calm that precedes the storm.</p>
            <p>About 9 o&apos;clock A. M. June 27th, Gen. Sherman ordered a general advance, and
                    several lines were hurled against our position on Kennesaw Mountain, the
                    strongest position which we held during the campaign. The firing was the
                    heaviest I ever heard, except the Sham Battle at Dalton. Though we were not
                    engaged we were in exact range of a battery which kept up an incessant cannonade
                    at a battery of ours, just across the creek from us, and the shells flew over
                    and around and among us thick and fast, with few casualties. We were moved up to
                    fill a gap in the works between Cheatham&apos;s and Hindman&apos;s
                    Divisions.</p>
            <p>From June 28th to July 2nd we moved from place to place, sometimes in the works,
                    sometimes in reserve, and sometimes building fortifications. At the &quot;Dead
                    Angle&quot; and for some distance to the right the rifle-pits were 8 ft. wide,
                    and were occupied by two lines of battle. Although the attack on the 27th was
                    everywhere repulsed, the enemy held every position that could not be reached by
                    our guns from our works. At the Dead Angle this was within 50 yds. of our lines,
                    and other places not much further off. Firing was kept up almost incessantly day
                    and night, and there was not much chance for restful sleep.</p>
            <p>The enemy having threatened our communications toward Atlanta, we abandoned our
                    communications on Kennesaw Mountain, on the night of July 2nd and retired to a
                    new position on the North side of the Chattahoochee River, where strong
                    fortifications had been erected by slaves and others.</p>
            <p>About 10 A. M. July 5th I was detailed to take charge of pickets of the regt. and
                    posted 3 or 4 hundred yds. in front of breastworks, just at the edge of a field.
                    We set to work to construct defences with rails and etc: but soon heard the
                    popping of rifles, and heard the whistle of minnie balls. Our fortifying ended,
                    and we took refuge behind what unfinished works we had. We returned the fire of
                    the enemy whom we could plainly see behind fence and trees beyond the field, and
                    we held them at bay. We could tell by the popping of rifles that they were
                    advancing on each side of the field. After awhile they deployed their
                    skirmishers behind a fence which ran across the field about halfway from the
                    side which we occupied to the one the enemy held. This fence row was grown up in
                    bushes, and furnished them some protection from our view, but we kept up the
                    firing. We could discover by the firing that they were driving our pickets on
                    each side of the field. When they had passed us on the West of left, where we
                    were near the corner of the field I ordered the men to fall back slowly to the
                    works, and fire at every enemy seen. The woods had a heavy undergrowth, and we
                    could see but a short distance in any direction, and each soldier had to act on
                    his own judgment. Serjt.</p>

            <p>29</p>
            <p>Newt Fields only remained with me. After going a hundred or so yards, we crossed
                    the road and also a small clearing, without enclosure, and an old log stable
                    standing in the opening. I could hear persons calling or hollering a little to
                    our right when looking to the front, and I said to Serjt. Fields that I must see
                    whether they were friends or foes, as I did not feel like leaving any of our own
                    men, in the rear. So I ran back across the road, when Serjt. F. called out
                    &quot;they are Yankees, I see one&quot;, and both he and the Federal fiered at
                    each other, and I distinctly heard the Federal&apos;s minei whistle past. We
                    then made our way into the works, to find that we were the last of our pickets
                    to come in.</p>
            <p>We held the line around the Chattahoochee River Bridge till July 9th, when we
                    crossed the River and picketed the South bank.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 18</p>
            <p>BATTLE OF PEACH TREE CREEK</p>
            <p>We had a period of comparative rest from July 10th to 18th though we picketed the
                    River (Chattahoochee) and watched the enemy on the opposite bank, sometimes
                    firing at whoever was seen, and sometimes talking to them.</p>
            <p>At dress parade on the evening of the 18th an order was read from Gen. Joe E.
                    Johnston informing the Army that he had been ordered to turn over the command to
                    Gen. Jno. B. Hood. We were astoundedand all turned away from the Parade Ground
                    looking as if we were just from a funeral.</p>
            <p>On the 19th we moved toward Peach Tree Creek, the enemy having crossed the River
                    to our right, and pressed back our cavalry. We fortified in two places working
                    till midnight. On the 20th in the evening we moved to the right and formed in
                    two lines. The three left companies of the 5th under command of Capt. B. F.
                    Peeples were deployed as skirmishers, and advanced about 3 P. M. Lt. J. W.
                    Howard advanced in front of the company cap in hand. We drove back the
                    enemy&apos;s skirmishers, to their line of battle which was fortified on a low
                    ridge. We halted in a ravine in less than a hundred yds. of the enemy&apos;s
                    works and in full view, and protected ourselves behind trees and etc as required
                    by the &quot;Army Regulations.&quot; Carter&apos;s Brigade soon came up and we
                    fought till night. About sundown, Lt. J. L. Lemonds came to me and said that he
                    was wounded, in the shoulder, and I would have to take command of the Company.
                    &quot;Where is Lt. Howard?&quot; said I. &quot;He is wounded worse than I am,&quot; he replied. (The wound was in the leg.)</p>
            <p>Private A. M. Pinson of Co. &quot;I&quot; was killed. I took command of the
                    company, and after dark, we recieved orders to fall back, which we did silently
                    and in good order. When we reached the regiment, Capt. B. F. Peeples resumed
                    command of the Co.</p>
            <p>On the 21st we retired into the fortifications of Atlanta, passing through the
                    suburbs, and rested the balance of the day.</p>

            <p>CHAPTER 19</p>
            <p>BATTLE OF ATLANTA</p>
            <p>Aroused before dawn and moved far to the right, and attacked the enemy
                    unexpectedly. Halting in an old field the order to load was given, and we knew
                    then that the enemy was not far away. When Capt. B. F. Peeples had repeated the
                    order, he walked back and forth behind the ranks with his head bowed, and I
                    suspected that he was praying. When he raised his head his face wore an
                    expression I had never seen before. Oh, how much I would have given then could I
                    have felt as confident of the Lord&apos;s protection, as I was satisfied that he
                    felt. He never showed any signs of fear during the day, but was calm and
                    unexcited.</p>
            <p>Advancing into the wood we soon engaged the enemy, and drove them from their
                    ready-cooked dinners, and partly built breastworks, killing Gen. McPherson, and
                    many others and taking many prisoners. We followed up our advantage driving them
                    through the woods, and into a field beyond. Just in the edge of the field was a
                    ravine, and here the advance halted, but without orders to do so. The lines were
                    reformed, and orders given to charge the enemy which had taken refuge behind an
                    old line of works which some of our commands had built on the previous day.
                    Though only a subordinate, I concluded I had as well lead as follow, and I waved
                    my hat over my head and called on the men to follow. On rising over the steep
                    part of the hill I came in full view of the long line of blue-coats who though
                    only protected to their waists, (being on the wrong side of the works,) they
                    looked dangerous enough. I looked around to see how much support I had to count
                    on, I saw only about half a dozen following closely. The balance were further
                    back and looked as if they were not fully decided to go. The minnie balls were
                    flying thick around me, and I looked for some protection. Spying a small
                    half-rotten stump, and dropping down behind it, I put my head near it, and
                    stretched myself on the ground as flat as I could get. Those who were nearest me
                    dropped down around me and the others stopped under cover of the hill. Several
                    minnies struck the stump, others plowed up the ground on either side, Gen.
                    Robertson was killed almost in an arms length of me. It was not long before we
                    were ordered to retire to the ravine and reform on the colors. I had no desire
                    to draw the enemy&apos;s fire and I lay still till the command was reformed and
                    moved off to the rear, under a heavy fire from the enemy. When the fire
                    slackened because many of the guns were being re-loaded, I made my retreat. Just
                    ahead of me Lt. J. R. Crosswell was following a path through the woods, and I
                    saw him fall, struck by a ball in his leg, but was able to rise and limp away.
                    When I had about reached the place where he fell, I struck my foot against
                    something like a stump of a bush, and fell forward to the ground, I caught on my
                    hands and Knees, and just then a minie ball struck the ground, and filled my
                    eyes and mouth with dirt. I rose as quick as I could and continued my retreat,
                    soon stopping behind a tree to catch my breath a little, and then hurrying on
                    till out of reach of the enemy&apos;s rifles. The command was soon rallied, but
                    without support it was use-less to undertake another charge and we awaited
                    developments, night soon coming on. Newt Fields, J. K. P. Lawson, and Geo.
                    Robertson were killed and buried on the field.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="0012_000244_000203_0033.jpg" xml:id="d3e920"/>
            <p>31</p>
            <p>Private John House was dangerously wounded, and left on the field, never being
                    heard from afterwards. Color-bearer Ab. Dinwiddie died of wounds recieved and
                    his brother Matt Dinwiddie of the color guard seriously wounded. Capt. A. W.
                    Caldwell one of the bravest and best officers of the regt. was wounded in the
                    hand, and died afterwards of fever.</p>
            <p>I was put on picket at noon of the 23rd and spent the evening and night
                    fortifying the picket posts, meanwhile the line of battle fortified in our rear.
                    During the day the dead of both sides were buried under a flag of truce. When I
                    came off duty at daylight I enjoyed the quiet and slept soundly and was much
                    refreshed after a week of arduous work tiresome marching, and severe fighting.
                    The enemy gradually extended their lines to our left, and on 27th, retired from
                    our immediate front, and all our troops were moved to the left except one
                    brigade of each division. Ours (Strahl&apos;s) being left to occupy the line of
                    Cheatham&apos;s Division.</p>
            <p>On the 28th, Stewart&apos;s Corps attacked the enemy&apos;s right, and though
                    fighting gallantly, and driving the enemy into their works, their loss was very
                    heavy, and no permanent good effected. Lt. Col. J. D. Wilson was severely
                    wounded while trying to rescue his brother, who had been wounded.</p>
            <p>From this time till Aug. 26th the enemy continued to extend his lines to our
                    left, and to close in towards the city, and meanwhile almost continual
                    skirmishing was kept up, and for a great part of the time, the shelling of the
                    city went on night and day. During this time we held our old position near the
                    battlefield of the 22nd of July. Much of the time one-third of the men were on
                    picket duty, one-third on fatigue duty erecting forts, and only one-third
                    resting. I was on picket duty six times during our stay there. We put brush
                    shelters over our rifle pits to protect us from the sun, and spent most of our
                    resting time lounging about the works.</p>
            <p>August 9th I went into the city, and visited Miss Jane Rathburn, a schoolmate,
                    and spent an hour with her, most of the time in the bombproof in the yard. It
                    was dug out about 6 ft. deep, and 8 ft. or ten ft. square, with steps cut in the
                    earth on opposite side from the direction which the shells came. It was covered
                    with rails and timbers, and all the earth removed was thrown back on top.
                    Several shells fell in different parts of the city while I was there. The
                    citizens had gotten pretty much used to the shelling and only took refuge in
                    their bombproofs when shells began to fall in that part of the city.</p>
            <p>About Aug. 27th or 28th the enemy completed their withdrawal from N. E. and N. of
                    the City, and leaving one army corps to guard his base at the bridge over the
                    Chattahoochee River, 8 miles N. of the city, he moved around towards the S. W.
                    to strike our communications at Jonesboro on the Ga. Central R. R. Gen. Hood not
                    knowing the magnitude of Gen. Sherman&apos;s movement, sent Gen. Hardee with two
                    Corps of the army to meet Sherman, while with the remaining Corps
                    (Stewart&apos;s) and the Georgia Militia, (consisting of old men and boys
                    mainly,) he remained at Atlanta to defend it.</p>

            <p>32</p>
            <p>BATTLE OF JONESBORO</p>
            <p>Gen. Hardee with his own Corps, and that of S. D. Lee, formerly Polk&apos;s,
                    followed up Gen. Sherman&apos;s movement, and at 10 o&apos;clock, Aug. 31st we
                    reached Jonesboro, and found Gen. Bates, Division slightly fortified on the west
                    of the town. Cheatham&apos;s and Cleburn&apos;s Divisions formed on the right of
                    Bates, and Lee&apos;s Corps to the right of them. About 3 P. M. we moved out and
                    attacked Sherman&apos;s Army, and were met by a murderous fire of grape,
                    shrapnel and musketry, and finding the attempt to dislodge the enemy futile we
                    were withdrawn. Wisehart, Barnhill, Seaton and Upchurch were wounded, and had we
                    not been protected by rising ground the loss would have been heavy.</p>
            <p>We spent the night throwing up fortifications, working by turns. The enemy
                    shelled us all night, at intervals of five minutes. One in each Co. would watch
                    for the flash of the cannon, and cry out, &quot;lie down.&quot; As soon as the
                    shell passed over or bursted we would resume our work. We completed our works by
                    noon of Sept. 1st and was compelled to extend our line to the left, till it was
                    in one rank only.</p>
            <p>Later our brigades were moved in succession to the right to support our forces
                    there, where the enemy were making a desperate effort to reach the R. R. and cut
                    our communication with Atlanta, and heavy fighting was going on. Our Brigade did
                    not reach the ground till sundown, and did not become engaged. I visited the
                    scene of this part of the engagement several days later, and found the trees
                    literally cut to pieces by the minie balls. Having failed to protect the R. R.
                    Gen. Hardee withdrew at night to Lovejoy Station six miles South of Jonesboro,
                    and threw up fortifications. About 10 o&apos;clock I was sent out in charge of
                    the pickets of the regts. Tyler&apos;s Brigade pickets who we relieved had dug
                    picket holes through an old field, and greatly exposed to the enemy&apos;s fire.
                    The position was immediately between a Federal battery and one of our own,
                    posted on a hill above us, and all the shots that fell short tore up the ground
                    around our picket posts. The enemy had taken position in front of us about 11 A.
                    M. Near sundown their skirmishers were advanced, but we repulsed the attack.</p>
            <p>We were kept on picket till dark of the 3rd. The continual firing exhausted our
                    ammunition, and it was imperative that it be replaced. Not liking to detail any
                    one for so perilous a task only as a last resort, I called for a volunteer, and
                    Private A. H. Lankford a gallant soldier, offered to make the attempt to bring
                    the ammunition from the line of battle about two hundred yds. in our rear. He
                    ran across the open intervening space and though drawing a heavy fire from the
                    enemy&apos;s pickets, he succeeded in getting back safely with a supply of
                    cartridges. About 4 P. M. the Federal Battery opened a heavy cannonading on our
                    fortifications, and as our battery was short of ammunition, (our supply having
                    been destroyed in the evacuation of Atlanta,) could not afford to reply, and the
                    Federals had things their own way. A shell struck the bank of earth in front of
                    the picket-hole next to the right of the one I was in, and partly covered the
                    men with earth. Seeing the danger they were in, I ordered them to abandon the
                    post temporarily, and disperse among the posts farther to the right, but to be
                    ready to return as soon as the battery ceased</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="0012_000244_000203_0035.jpg" xml:id="d3e955"/>
            <p>33</p>
            <p>firing, to be prepared for a charge, should it be made, and as the shells were
                    striking dangerously near the post I occupied I moved the men to the posts to
                    our left. When the firing ceased I ordered all back to their stations. We were
                    relieved at dark, and the opportunity to sleep and rest was enjoyed indeed.</p>
            <p>Gen. Hood having evacuated Atlanta upon recieving notice from Gen. Hardee that
                    the enemy held the R. R. near Jonesboro, the Federals retired from our front
                    going to Atlanta, and we were permitted to rest after our hard campaign. We
                    followed them beyond Jonesboro, and took position near the hard fought ground of
                    the 1st of Sept. On the night of the 10th I was taken sick with Bilious Fever.
                    Remained in camp till 13th and then rode a horse to Division Hospital, where I
                    had a cot in a tent, and Dr. Buchanan was very faithful in his attendance.</p>
            <p>On the 18th, the army was moved to Palmetto on Atlanta and West Point R. R. and
                    all the sick that could be moved were sent South. We stopped awhile at Griffin,
                    and then were carried on to Macon, arriving about sunup Sept. 19th and put in
                    Floyd House Hospital. Lt. J. P. Tyler, and Tom Buchanan, Doodle Daniel and
                    LaMotte were with me. Continued to improve in health, and on 24th was sent back
                    to command. At Columbus had to wait for a train till the 26th, and our rations
                    becoming exhausted suffered for want of food but luckily found a five dollar
                    bill, and soon bought enough to satisfy my hunger, paying a dollar each for a
                    small pie and ordinary ginger-cake. Failing to get a train Lt. Tyler, Lamotte
                    and myself boarded a freight train, and went to Opelika, Ala., and took a train
                    to West Point, where we spent the night. On the 27th we went on another freight
                    train to Palmetto. Found that the 4th, 5th, 31st, 33rd and 38th regts. had been
                    consolidated into one regt. with Col. A. J. Kellar of the 4th in command. Capt.
                    B. F. Peeples, and Lieuts. J. P. Tyler, F. M. Clark and myself assigned to duty
                    with one company, the regiment being thus reduced to two companies. What
                    depletion from 1,300 men with which we entered the Army.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 21</p>
            <p>BACK TO TENNESSEE</p>
            <p>Early on the morning of Sept. 29th we started to Sherman&apos;s rear to break his
                    communications and try to force his retreat. Crossed the Chattahoochee River
                    that day on a pontoon, and hurried on to strike the R. R. which we did near Big
                    Shanty and fortified while the other commands tore up several miles of the W.
                    and A. R. R. and threatened Altoona Heights, where Gen. Sherman had a months
                    reserve rations stored and strongly fortified. It was here that he sent over our
                    heads from Kennesaw Mountain to Altoona, his now famous signal message, &quot;Hold the Fort for I am coming,&quot; which long afterwards inspired Ira D.
                    Sankey to write his famous song with that title.</p>
            <p>On the approach of Sherman&apos;s army we retired towards Rome, and making nearly
                    the entire circuit of that fortified place, we struck the W. and A. R. R. again,
                    Lees Corps struck the R. R. at Calhoun and Resaca, and the others at Dalton
                    where we found a fort occupied by about 800 men mostly negroes. The officers
                    refused at first to surrender, but after our lines were formed, and ready for
                    assault, they changed their minds, and sonsented to lay</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="0012_000244_000203_0036.jpg" xml:id="d3e975"/>
            <p>34</p>
            <p>down their arms, and the negroes were put to work tearing up the R. R. and made
                    to work very hard, meanwhile our own command was scattered along other parts of
                    the track similarly engaged. We would tear up the rails with crowbars and etc,
                    pile up the crossties and put the rails across them, set them on fire, and when
                    redhot, bend down each end to the ground or taking them to a telegraph pole,
                    carry the ends around till they met or crossed, thus making them unfit to use.
                    Some of the soldiers found their father&apos;s negroes in the Federal
                    command.</p>
            <p>We worked until 10 P. M. that night (October 13th) and resumed it early next
                    morning, but by noon, the near approach of Sherman&apos;s Army, (who had found
                    by this time where we were,) forced us to desist, and we turned our faces toward
                    Northern, Ala. The enemy&apos;s cavalry dashed into Dalton and picked up a few
                    of our stragglers. We had ruined the R. R. track from Calhoun to Rocky Face Gap.
                    Gen. Sherman&apos;s Army followed us but a short distance from the R. R.</p>
            <p>From Oct. 14th to 26th we marched to Decatur, Ala. passing through the towns of
                    Walker, LaFayette, Alpine and Gadsen. At the latter place we were again in
                    communication with our base, supplies being shipped to Montevallo, Ala. by rail,
                    and hauled to Gadsden. Our short rations ceased for a few days, and were now
                    plentiful, and much needed clothing was issued.</p>
            <p>At night of the 20th we heard Gen&apos;s Beauregard, Hood, Lee, Cheatham,
                    Cleburne, Bate, Clayton and etc speak, and we were assured that we were going to
                    Tenn. and that we would be able to stay there if we did our duty. The soldiers
                    were hopeful and in fine spirits.</p>
            <p>While crossing Sand Mountain between Gadsden and Decatur we suffered for rations,
                    and there were none to be had by foraging as the country was very rough and
                    thinly settled.</p>
            <p>On the 17th our company formed the rear guard and it was a great relief to be out
                    of the moving mass of men, wagons, artillery and etc, and there was more freedom
                    in our movements. We captured some stragglers and pilferers. On the 23rd our
                    regiment formed the advance guard, and here again we enjoyed the situation. It
                    gave us the first chance at buying or begging little extras in the way of fruit,
                    vegetables, milk, butter, eggs, poultry and etc. And I am sorry to say it
                    afforded some who were void of a sense of right, to take by force what they were
                    unable to buy or beg. On the 24th the Brigade marched in advance again, as no
                    other one was ready, when the order came to move.</p>
            <p>At Decatur, Ala. our rations were shorter than ever. On the 26th we recieved only
                    a small allowance of beef and half an ear of corn each, and on the 27th only an
                    ear of corn each. The officers had to stand guard over their horses, when fed,
                    to keep the corn from being stolen. Some of us roasted acorns to splice out the
                    short supply.</p>
            <p>On the 27th, 28th and 29th we threatened the Federal fort at Decatur, and our
                    fears were greatly aroused that we would be called upon to charge it, but to our
                    indescribable joy we moved off about 3 P. M. on the latter day, towards
                    Tuscumbia. There were some rash threats from the men that they would not obey
                    orders of the commanding general Jno. B. Hood to undertake what they regarded
                    the rash attempt, as it was fully believed the enemy could be flanked out of his
                    position without loss of life. We passed</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="0012_000244_000203_0037.jpg" xml:id="d3e997"/>
            <p>35</p>
            <p>through the beautiful Tennessee River Valley around Courtland, desolated by
                    Streight&apos;s raid in the Spring of 1863, and reached Tuscumbia at 4 P. M.
                    Oct. 31st.</p>
            <p>At Tuscumbia we were again in touch with our base at Cherokee, to which the
                    trains were running. And we were again permitted to get full rations. Soap was
                    issued, and we rubbed our wrists raw trying to get our soiled clothes to look
                    like they were partly clean. It rained heavily for several days and it was
                    almost impossible to keep the Pontoon Bridge at Florence in condition to cross,
                    but finally on Nov. 13th about 9 A. M. we crossed from South Florence to
                    Florence, and awaited the crossing of the other commands of the Army.</p>
            <p>On Nov. 21st we were again put in motion, on the 22nd after marching 18 miles,
                    passed a large sign reading &quot;Tennessee Line.&quot; Loud cheers went up as
                    each regiment passed it, and Tennesseans especially were glad to once more tread
                    the soil of the &quot;Volunteer State.&quot; As Cheatham&apos;s Division were
                    all Tennesseans, it was natural that we should enjoy re-entering the State more
                    than soldiers from other States. Some snow fell on the 21st but melted as it
                    fell. But the weather turned bitter cold, and as we were thinly clad, and were
                    without tents we suffered no little.</p>
            <p>We reached the vicinity of Columbia on the morning of the 27th and found the
                    enemy intrenched there. They evacuated the town however that night, but held the
                    opposite bank. On the 29th we crossed the Duck River 6 miles above town, and
                    took a country road to Spring Hill, where we tried to cut off their retreat by
                    the pike. At one point our road approached so near the turnpike on which the
                    Federals were moving, that the 4th and 5th regts. were thrown out to the left as
                    skirmishers to protect the marching column. Relieved soon after, and moved on
                    overtaking the Division near Spring Hill at dark. The attack on the moving
                    Federals was postponed, and we lay within a quarter of a mile of the pike, and
                    heard the passing of the enemy all night, the rumbling of the wagons and
                    artillery being very distinct.</p>
            <p>At daylight next morning after all the enemy had passed, Forrest&apos;s Cavalry
                    started in pursuit and we soon followed and marching hard we reached the
                    vicinity of Franklin about noon.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 22</p>
            <p>BATTLE OF FRANKLIN</p>
            <p>A line of battle was formed at the foot of a range of hills, and at 4 P. M. when
                    all the commands were up, we were ordered to advance. As it was mostly through
                    open fields the sight was a grand one. Cleburne&apos;s Division moved on the
                    right of the pike, and Cheatham&apos;s on the left. A band played &quot;Dixie&quot; on one side of the pike, and one on the other &quot;The Bonnie Blue
                    Flag.&quot; A Battery galloped up the pike and reaching a small elevation to
                    the left, wheeled out unhindered, opened fire, and as we came up, limbered up
                    and advanced again.</p>
            <p>We were in the second line and perhaps 200 yds. in rear of the first, having a
                    good opportunity to witness the attack. The long lines moved forward almost with
                    the precision of the drillfield, except when broken in crossing fences, some of
                    which were</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="0012_000244_000203_0038.jpg" xml:id="d3e1022"/>
            <p>36</p>
            <p>stone, and in avoiding the farm houses and outhouses.</p>
            <p>Our first line drove the enemy from their first line of works speedily, capturing
                    some of them, and followed the others closely to their second line of works.
                    When we had passed the first works, Capt. B. F. Peeples said to me, &quot;Look
                    how thick the Yankees are coming.&quot; I replied, &quot;They are without arms
                    Captain.&quot; He looked again, and said &quot;That is so.&quot; They had
                    been overtaken by our men, and ordered to throw down their arms and go to the
                    rear, and they were fleeing from the bullets of their own men, and making fine
                    speed.</p>
            <p>As the next line of works, at the edge of the town formed a semi-circle, reaching
                    from the Big Harpeth River above town to the river below, the troops converged
                    towards the town and also losing all semblance of lines, moved in bodies
                    separated sometimes from each other. I did not regret that one of these bodies
                    was between me and the enemy. When our first line reached the second line of
                    works they were much too thinned in numbers, scattered, mixed up and fatigued to
                    carry the works, and they dropped down in front of the breastworks, and as near
                    as they could get. When our second line came up, they followed the example and
                    when I reached the works there were many both in front and rear of me, as well
                    as on either side. In vain the officers tried to urge them forward. They
                    remained flat on their faces, except those nearest the works who fired at the
                    enemy, and passed their guns back to others to reload, taking their loaded ones
                    in return.</p>
            <p>A few men at one time pushed over the works, but finding themselves unsupported
                    they crawled back. Just in front of us a part of the line was abandoned by the
                    enemy, but they were posted behind adjacent houses, and kept up an incessant
                    fire. Just across the pike stood an old cotton-gin-house, which was filled by
                    Federal soldiers, which added to those who manned the works, made a strong
                    force, from which the fire was so heavy that Cleburne was unable to dislodge
                    them, he being killed while trying to urge his men forward. Night came on and
                    our troops across the pike fell back from the murderous fire, and the Federals
                    then turned their aim at us on the left, by the light of the moon, and many were
                    killed, and many more fled to the rear. Gen. O. F. Strahl, our brigadier, and
                    one of our best and bravest brigade commanders was killed just in front of me,
                    and some of his staff were killed near by.</p>
            <p>Orders were given to retire, but I retained my position, doing what I could in
                    passing the loaded guns to the front, and empty ones to the rear. When all the
                    men to my right, front, and rear, and most of those to my left, had retired, I
                    thought it time to go also. So waiting till one of the heavy volleys, which
                    followed each other at irregular intervals, had ceased, I arose and sped to the
                    rear as fast as I could run, hoping to get some distance, while most of the
                    enemy were reloading their guns. I had gone less than a hundred yards when a
                    very heavy volley was fired and the air seemed full of bullets, more so than at
                    any time in life. Thoroughly scared I increased my speed to the utmost of my
                    strength, and agility. Other volleys followed, but I reached the outer line of
                    works without being struck, and I tumbled over the breastwork, and lay there
                    gasping for breath, until I had regained my strength, when I proceeded to
                    retreat to the place where we had first formed.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="0012_000244_000203_0039.jpg" xml:id="d3e1038"/>
            <p>37</p>
            <p>Other men of the regiment soon came up and the remnant was collected by the
                    morning. Desultory firing was kept up till about 3 A. M. when the enemy
                    evacuated the town of Franklin, and retreated towards Nashville. Meanwhile some
                    of us obtained some sleep.</p>
            <p>Privates Edgar and Ridgeway of the regt. were killed. Every one of the original
                    Company &quot;D&quot; but myself and two others were wounded. (I am sorry that
                    my &quot;Diary&quot; does not give their names.) W. D. Hendricks, Ellis and
                    perhaps J. M. Coffman among them. I walked over the battlefield on the next
                    morning, Dec. 1st and saw for the only time during the war, dead men thick
                    enough to walk upon without stepping on the ground. The day was spent burying
                    our dead and caring for the wounded. On the morning of the next day (Dec. 2nd) I
                    was sent with a detail of men to assist in burying the enemy&apos;s dead, but
                    finding no one to report to, returned to camp.</p>
            <p>T. G. Morris Jr. and S. A. Miller left at Franklin&apos;s barefooted.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 23</p>
            <p>BATTLE OF NASHVILLE</p>
            <p>The useless loss of life at the Battle of Franklin, weakened the confidence of
                    the Army in Gen. J. B. Hood, and shattered its morale, and led no doubt to the
                    disaster at Nashville which virtually closed its war record. At 9 o&apos;clock
                    A. M. Dec. 2nd we were put in motion, and marched 17 miles, camping within 3
                    miles of Nashville.</p>
            <p>On the 3rd we moved up to within a mile of the enemy&apos;s intrenchments, near
                    the residence of Mrs. A. V. Brown, widow of Ex. Gov. A. V. Brown, and at night
                    fortified Ranger&apos;s Hill.</p>
            <p>Only corn issued again in lieu of bread, and our rations were short and rough for
                    some days. We burned many cedar rails which cost originally ten cents each. Such
                    is war.</p>
            <p>On the 8th I obtained a pass for 24 hours and went out beyond Nolensville, and
                    spent the night at Mr. H. Toombs&apos;, whose brother I knew in Henry Co.
                    Secured some forage as we call country victuals, and carried it to camp. It was
                    very welcome to both myself and messmates. I had been compelled to look out
                    messmates from other companies, and I selected Lt. F. M. Clark and Private A. H.
                    Lankford. The time till Dec. 15th was spent in fortifying and changing positions
                    several times. We were very scarce of wood and it turned cold on the 7th and
                    sleeted and snowed all forenoon of the 9th, turning colder afterwards, and we
                    suffered much.</p>
            <p>On the 15th the enemy moved out of the city and attacked our left. We were moved
                    to the extreme left, about 4 P. M. and our company deployed as skirmishers.
                    Enemy did not advance near us. At dark we were relieved.</p>
            <p>During the following night we moved back to a new position across the &quot;Granny White Pike,&quot; and fortified. I was put in charge of the picket at
                    daylight. We fortified the picket line. After the middle of the day skirmishing
                    commenced on our left, and from the sound our left, seemed to be pressed back
                    till the enemy was towards our rear. We were in thick woods, and there being
                    higher ground to our right and left so that but little could be</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="0012_000244_000203_0040.jpg" xml:id="d3e1067"/>
            <p> 38 </p>
            <p>Seen. About 4 P. M. the enemy made a general advance, and soon I saw the pickets
                    to our right falling back. After waiting to see if the would return to their
                    posts, and finding that they did not, and seeing the enemy advancing in our
                    front, I ordered those under my command to retire to our breastworks, which they
                    did in good order. When I reached the trenches, our regiment had already been
                    ordered to retire. They had gone only a few steps when some officer called out,
                    &quot;Go back to the works,&quot; and Capt. B. F. Peeples repeated the order to
                    his company, and I met them just immediately that I crossed the trenches. A few
                    hundred yards to the right, the line of works made an abrupt turn to the rear,
                    and extended through open fields, plainly visible to me from the works and
                    little ridge on which we stood. Looking across the fields I saw that the greater
                    part of the line had lifted from the works and was streaming across the fields
                    to the rear. As I met Capt. Peeples, I pointed across the fields and said,
                    &quot;Look yonder, if you ever expect to get out of here, you had better be
                    going.&quot; He gave the command pretty soon to retreat, as he took in the
                    situation at a glance. Some of the men either failed to hear the order or were
                    negligent about obeying, and were captured. </p>
            <p>I started across the field, and felt glad that I was not encumbered with a gun
                    and cartridges. Having only my sword, blanket short rations and a change of
                    underclothing I could make pretty good headway. But as the ground was just
                    thawing out of a hard freeze, and there was enough grass in the cornfield to
                    make it stick, I was soon carrying a heavy load of mud on each foot. One shoe
                    became untied and as I could not afford to lose it, I was compelled to stop and
                    tie it, even though the balls were flying thick around me. All order was lost,
                    and every man looked after himself. A few soilders would stop and fire back at
                    their pursuers, and reload as they still retreated. A few hundred yards further
                    I noticed we were approaching a bold wooded ridge pretty steep, on the side
                    nearest us and I shuddered to think how the enemy would gain on us, while we
                    climbed it, and how we would be at their mercy as we toiled up the slope.
                    Getting nearer I noticed that the men as they neared its foot were turning along
                    its base to the left. We soon entered a body of woods, and a short distance
                    beyond came to a gap, through which ran a road and through which our soilders
                    were passing in a continual stream. </p>
            <p>Lt. Col. Lucke W. Finly of the 4th regt. which formed a part of the consolidated
                    regt. of which the 5th was a part, was running back and forth with a drawn
                    pistol ordering the men to stop and form, and swearing that he would shoot
                    anyone who tired to pass him. But while he would be on one side of the road,
                    they would pass on the other side, and vice versa.</p>
            <p>Knowing that he knew me, and thinking that in his raving he might hastily decide
                    to make an example of me, I stopped till the passing crowds were so think that I
                    could mingle with them unrecognized, and I passed on.</p>
            <p>A citizen who knew the route was induced by some officer to pilot us to the
                    &quot;Franklin Pike.&quot; The road for two miles passed down a long ravine, and
                    suddenly came in sight of the &quot;Pike,&quot; along which the rear of the mein
                    body od our Army was retreating helter-skelter, and a Federal battery was
                    throwing shells among them. We obliqued to the right and joined the mass of
                    demoralized mean a mile perhaps further on, no longer deserving the name of </p>

            <p>39</p>
            <p>Army, and entirely without organization.</p>
            <p>night soon came on, and the different commands began to rendevouz around the
                    colors of their respective regiments, each man or group of men, as they came up
                    enquiring where such and such a Div. was. We lay down on the wet ground, and
                    slept off the fatigue of the day. </p>
            <p>We marched to within 2 miles of Franklin next day, and then next day to Spring
                    Hill. I stopped long enough at Franklin to visit our sick and wounded at the
                    hospital. Most of whom were able to go on with us, or be carried.</p>
            <p>We drew rations at Franklin, and our commands that day resumed our orderly manner
                    of marching, thus bringing order out of chaos. The rain that day made the
                    &quot;pike&quot; very sloppy, and we waded through pulverized lime almost
                    &quot;shoe mouth deep&quot;.</p>
            <p>On the evening of the 18th we camped on a creek, 4 miles from Columbia. On the
                    19th, my shoes being nearly worn out I was sent forward with the barefooted
                    squad, preceeding the Army all the way out of Tennessee.</p>
            <p>We could draw rations but our barefooted squad could cook them only as we could
                    borrow cooking utensils. It snowed on the evening of the 21st and turned very
                    cold, so we suffered much. Had walnuts for &quot;Christmas Dinner,&quot; so
                    Tommy Dillon of Co. &quot;K&quot; said write.</p>
            <p>Reached the Tennessee rive at Bainbridge on the 27th, and crossed on the Pontoon
                    Bridge. Broken wagons, dead animals, and other debris strewed the road, and
                    after leaving the &quot;Pike,&quot; the mud seemed bottomless.</p>
            <p>We found the Memphis and Charleston R. R. had been repaired to within 3 miles of
                    Tuscumbia, and here we were enables to secure full rations once more.</p>
            <p>As my diary closes with the end of the year I will have only my memory to aid me
                    in writing the events of 1865, which closed the War. My account will therefore
                    be liable to include some errors, and I cannot be specific.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 24</p>
            <p>A FRULOUGH AND VISIT HOME</p>
            <p>When we reached Corinth we met Lt. J. L. Lemonds, who had secured a large lot of
                    clothing, for our regt. from our relatives and friends, and brought it in a
                    wagon to Corinth. Some of who had no near relatives or negligent ones, or whose
                    relatives lived to near the enemies posts, or in the vicinity of Union
                    sympathizers. We were a happy set. I recieved a full suit from top to toe.</p>
            <p>All of the West Tennessee troops were furloughed for 30 days with orders to
                    report at West Point, Miss. at the end of that time. So we started home in
                    squads of various sizes. There were seven I think, in the one which I was. I can
                    call to mind only three of them now, T. G. Morris Sr., Uriah Hancock, and his
                    younger brother. As we were unencumbered with arms, ammunition, we felt very
                    light, and being also very light hearted we made good time traveling the first
                    day, 33 miles. My new boots made sad havoc with my feet, skinning one of them so
                    that I could not wear my boot, and begging for an old shoe, I secured an old
                    over-shoe, and work it several days till my foot was well enough to allow me to
                    wear my boot again. We obtained permission for the first night to </p>
            <pb n="42" facs="0012_000244_000203_0042.jpg" xml:id="d3e1117"/>
            <p>40</p>
            <p>sleep in a kitchen; using our own blankets for bedding on the hard floor, but
                    sleeping well. Before retiring the younger Hancock went to the cupboard, and
                    pouring a glass of butter-mild drank it. The others of us were not willing that
                    the hospitality shown us should thus be abused, and we told him that we should
                    next moring diwown any blame for it, and tell our host who was the guilty one.
                    This very much mortified his older brother and he also chided his brother for
                    his act. Not much effect however was apparently made on him, but he was careful
                    afterwards not to do anything he thought we would disapprove. </p>
            <p>We proceeded the following days more moderately. We were traveling through a
                    country where the sentiments of the people where decidedly for the Union, and
                    which furnished two regiments to the Federal Army, -------Hawkings, and we felt
                    we were in danger of being bushwhacked as irregular bodies of playouts roamed
                    the country. when they knew Gen. Forrest or any of his cavalry was not about.
                    One day we saw a small body of horsemen coming up the road behind us in a
                    gallop, and we hardly knew whether to take to the bushes or not, as we were
                    unarmed, there being only one old pistol for defense. Some one remarked that the
                    bushwhackers always traveled on foot, so that they could pass through the woods
                    and thus avoid the traveled highways. So we kept on our way, not however without
                    some trepidation. When they came up and saw who we were, they announced
                    themselves as Confederate guerillas, and after talking with us a little, and
                    finding out who we were, and where we were going, they rode off.</p>
            <p>We spent a night a few miles south of Lexington, and there heard that there were
                    some irregular Federals in town, but anxious to avoid loss of time, we secured
                    the services of our host, whom we had found to be a true Southerner to precede
                    us and while making some purchases, to investigate the rumor, and meet us at a
                    mill, between his place and town and give us the facts. He did so and told us
                    the way was clear, and we proceeded passing boldly through the town, but keeping
                    our etes open for enemies. </p>
            <p>At Albany, 6 miles south of Paris we came in sight of the Memphis and Ohio R. R.
                    and comrade T. G. Morris Jr. and myself decided to leave the muddy public road
                    and walk the R. R. We had not gone far before we regretted the change, for as
                    the road had not been used for several years, and in the cuts the clay had
                    washed down and completely covered the crossties, and the walking was much worse
                    than the public road. Had we kept the latter, we would have soon been met by Mr.
                    T. G. Morris Sr. and Rev. Asa Cox, who had heard from other soilders of our
                    coming, and had secured extra horses and started out to meet us. We reached Rev.
                    Asa Cox&apos;s about nightfall, and spent the night.</p>
            <p>Here T. G. Morris Jr. heard of the recent death of his favorite sister, (Miss
                    Lucy M.) and the pleasure of his visit was henceforth robbed of one of its
                    pleasures. </p>
            <p>Here I had the pleasure of meeting my affianced, but only in the presence of
                    other, which detracted much from its enjoyment. Next morning we obtained
                    conveyences, and reached home in the forenoon, and rejoiced once more to see the
                    loved ones, and to spend a few days with them.</p>
            <p>Some parties were given in honor of the few soldiers who were so fortunate as to
                    get home. Many were dead who started out</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="0012_000244_000203_0043.jpg" xml:id="d3e1137"/>
            <p>41</p>
            <p>with us in such high spirits, others were in prison, other n hospitals, and
                    others still on detached service. But we had become used to such things, and
                    made much of what opportunities for pleasure we had still left with us. </p>
            <p>The month rolled waay very quickly, or so much of it as we could remain at home
                    and yet leave enough time to reach our rendezvous by the time our furloughs
                    expired.</p>
            <p>A good many thought the cause already lost, and that it was useless to return to
                    the Army, and remained at home. I could not get my consent to do anything else
                    but to return to my post of duty, and share the fate of those who were not
                    furloughed, and were still with the Army. Those who returned generally secured
                    some kind of horses and rode back. My father furnished me a little sorrel pony,
                    and in the latter part of January in company with Comrade R. D. curd of the 12th
                    Tenn. and Comrade T. G. Morris jr. of my old Co. started back to Miss. going by
                    way of McLemonsville, Jackson, Bolivar and etc. The people who whre southern in
                    sympathy treated us very kindly, and we had good food to eat, and nice beds to
                    sleep in. </p>
            <p>CHAPBER 25</p>
            <p>THE CLOSING MONTHS OF THE WAR</p>
            <p>On reaching North Mississippi we learned that the Army of Tennessee had gone to
                    North Carolina to try and check Gen. Sherman&apos;s advance from Wilmington, and
                    the rendezvou had been changed to some point further down the Mobile and Ohio R.
                    R. (perhaps Verona.)</p>
            <p>Before arriving there we stopped one night at the camp of the 7th Tenn. Cav. G.
                    of which had been recruited in Henry Co. and in which we had many friends.
                    comrades Morris and Curd decided that they were already mounted and needed, to
                    meet cavalry raids, that they would remain with that command, but I felt that my
                    duty required that I return to my own command, and I bade them goodby and
                    proceeded alone. </p>
            <p>On reaching the rendezvous, I was glad to find Lieut. J. L. Lemonds was Adjt. of
                    the Post. I reported for duty, and obtained permission to ride on further till I
                    could sell my horse. The next day I stopped at a cavalry camp and sold my horse
                    to an officer for $700.00 in Confederate funds, $600.00 of which was in bonds,
                    drawing seven dollars and thirty cents per hundred dollars, per annum or 2 cents
                    per day, and called seven-thirty bonds. </p>
            <p>I took the train at the nearest station securing transportation from the Post
                    Quartermaster to Augusta, Ga. going by rail to selma, via Meridian, and by
                    steamboat to Montgomery.</p>
            <p>I was taken with fever, and secured a state room, and spent a restless night. An
                    old Jew who occupied the other berth in the same state-room, took pity on me and
                    brought me a drink of water, which was greatly enjoyed. On reaching Montgomery
                    the next morning, my fever having cooled down, I went to the Post Surgeon, and
                    told him I was unable to go further, and asked that I be sent to the hospital,
                    and was sent to the St. Mary&apos;s Hospital, just across the street from the
                    First Baptist Chruch. </p>
            <p>The Sisters of Mercy had charge of preparing and distrib</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="0012_000244_000203_0044.jpg" xml:id="d3e1166"/>
            <p>42</p>
            <p>uting the food for the sick, and I was for the first time in life brought into
                    contact with the Catholics. The Sisters moved about so silently and quietly that
                    we would not know they were about till we saw them. They had negro servants to
                    help them but scarcely ever spoke to them, having them so well-trained that it
                    was not necessary. They were very kind to us, and would help us in any way they
                    could. </p>
            <p>Their kind treatment added to the good service of he male nurses, and skillful
                    treatmen to the surgeons, soon enabled me to breakthe &quot;billous fever,&quot;
                    and I improved quite rapidly. While convalescent I bouth some oilcloth, and
                    borrowing a needle and scissors from the &quot;sisters&quot; I made two good
                    haversacks, one to carry my ratons in and, one my change of clothing. </p>
            <p>One Sunday night I attendeed services at the First Baptist Church, taking a seat
                    just inside the door, and directly under the &quot;Organ Loft&quot;. I never
                    heard a pipe organ, and when the choir and instrumetn struck up the
                    &quot;Voluntary&quot; without previous notice, I almost jumped from my seat. The
                    hymn or anthem was &quot;Sing Praises, Sing Praises,&quot; and I thought it
                    grand. The sermon was also fine, but I do not know who the preacher was. </p>
            <p>I found Lt. Elisha Paschall of the 46th Tenn. at the hospital being treated for
                    an ingrowing toe-nail. He became able to travle about the same time that I did,
                    and he was my travelling companion to Augusta, Ga. We traeled most of the way by
                    rail, goin via West Point, Atlanta, Macon, Milledgeville to Sparta, to Augusta.
                    We found Atlanta in ruins, burned my Sherman&apos;s men when he evacuated it to
                    make his &quot;march to the sea.&quot;</p>
            <p>We had to walk from Milledgeville to Sparta. Stopping to rest by the roadside, I
                    san &quot;Carry me back to Old Virginny once more,&quot; and it moved Lt.
                    Paschall, that he begged me to quit, saying that he &quot;would have to desert
                    and go home if I did not,&quot; and whenever he met me after the war, he always
                    wanted to hear me sing it again.</p>
            <p>At Barnet we met several of our comrades who had been captured at Missionary
                    Ridge and Nashville, and kept in prison, who were now paroled, and were on their
                    way home, but were saddened to hear of those who had sickened and died in
                    prison.</p>
            <p>Arriving at Augusta, we were ordered to the rendezous at Hamburg, S. C. just
                    across the river, whre all who were returning from furlough, from hospitals, and
                    from detached service were colleted, organized into companies and regiments
                    temporarily, officered, furnished with commissaries, clothing and wagons, and
                    prepared to march to rejoin our Army in North Carolina.</p>
            <p>Sherman had recently burned Columbia, and hundreds of homeless refugees had
                    flocked to Augusta for shelter and food, which the people and government were
                    striving to give them. A number of ameteur musicians gave a concert the proceeds
                    of which were given them to aid in supplying their necessities. Many of us
                    soldiers attended and cheerfully paid ten dollars admission fee, to help in this
                    commendable enterprise. A green lieutenant from Arkansas, became so thoroughly
                    tickled at a comic song, that he laughed continously, his broad guffaw rising
                    above all other sounds, till they cried out all over the house, &quot;put him on
                    stage, put him on stage.&quot;</p>
            <p>I went to the branch Depository of the Treasury, and collected the interest on my
                    bonds but could not use the bonds themselves. As they were not currency, and
                    therefore not legal tender.</p>

            <p>In a few days we were ready for marching and started for N. C. Capt. B. F.
                    Peeples had been put in command of a temporary company, but owing to a
                    superabundance of officers, the balance of the officers of the regt. were
                    supernumeraries.</p>
            <p>At Edgefield Court House, 4 of us, Adjt. W. D. Kendall, Lt. N. C. Howeard, Ensign
                    J. W. Crutchfield and myself, obtained permission from the commanding officer of
                    the marching column, to diverge from the main command, and choose our own route,
                    and turning to the right we set out through the country, and has a splended
                    time. We would take it by turns to seek entertainment. It was made the duty of
                    one of us to find a place where we could get dinner, and in the evening, supper,
                    lodging and breakfast. We kept up a friendly rivalry as to who could secure the
                    best places to dine and lodge at. We were royally treated at most places, the
                    citizens never having had enough soldiers to entertain, for them to tire of it.
                    We usually found places where there was a piano, and enjoyed the music. We had
                    lively times talking with and joking each other, and being &quot;hail fellows
                    well-met,&quot; we had a regular picnic. The weather was fine, everything
                    putting on the spring garb, and all nature in harmony with out light
                    heartedness.</p>
            <p>At Blackstock near Chester, S. C. we reached the point where Sherman left off
                    destroying the R. R. and we took the cars, but soon came to where
                    Stoneman&apos;s raid from East Tenn. had cut the road and burned the bridges,
                    and we would have to walk to where we could get another train. </p>
            <p>On reaching Raliegh, N. C. Lt. Howard and I spent the night at Rev. W. W.
                    Crowder&apos;s who had lived in Henry Co., Tenn. and had many relatives there.
                    He treated us very kindly. </p>
            <p>A few miles east of Raliegh we met the remnant of the once powerful Army of Tenn.
                    again under its faourite commander, Gen. Joe E. Johnston and just falling back
                    from the battle of Bentonville, where it had just had its last fight with
                    Sherman&apos;s Army. It had been joined by all the forces from Savannah,
                    Charleston, Wilmington, and other points on the coast, but was still too weak to
                    meet the hosts of Sherman&apos;s Army swelled by other forces also. </p>
            <p>The Confederate Congress had recently passed a new law, by which different
                    commands could be consolidated permanently instead of temporarily as heretofore,
                    and near Raliegh the consolidation in the Army of Tenn. was effected. </p>
            <p>The 5th Tenn. having only 26 men all told it was too small to make a company
                    even, so it and the 4th Tenn. (with which it had for 2 1/2 years been operating)
                    was formed into one company. One of the Captains of the 4th was put in command,
                    the first lieutenancy having been offered to several lieutenants in succession,
                    and declined by each, was finally given to Lt. A. W. Sidebottom of Co
                    &quot;A&quot;, who was either in a Northern prison or on his way home on parole.
                    A second lieutenant from the 4th was appointed and the third lieutenancy (or
                    bsevet 2nd lieutenancy) was abolished. </p>
            <p>The law provided that all supernumerary officers should be allowed to select the
                    arm of service in which they preferrd, and all of the 5th officers decided to go
                    to Forrest&apos;s Cavalry, which operated nearer their homes than any other
                    command.</p>
            <p>But Gen. Lee&apos;s &quot;Army of Northern Virginia&quot; having surrendered,
                    thus relieving Grant&apos;s Army they were on their way to join Sherman, and
                    there was no alternative but for Gen. Johnston to</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="0012_000244_000203_0046.jpg" xml:id="d3e1217"/>
            <p>44</p>
            <p>surrender also. </p>
            <p>When it was announced that Gen. Johnston had decided to surrender, there was such
                    a scene as I have never witnessed, and such as has seldom been witnessed in the
                    world&apos;s history. Different persons were affected in accordance with their
                    different temperments. Some sat down and remained silent, some sat down and
                    buried their faces in their hands, to hide their falling tears, others raved and
                    swore they would never surrender, while still others looked on bewildered, and
                    hardly knowing what to do or say. To this latter class I belonged.</p>

            <p>RETURN HOME TO CIVIL LIFE</p>
            <p>On April 24th, 1865 when ready to surrender there were present for duty of the
                    5th Tenn. Vol. Inf. only thirty men, out of thirteen hundred who had served in
                    its rank and file. The following list of them is copied from one made by me at

            <p>When it was decided fully that the Army would be surrendered several of us who
                    were supernumery officers decided that nothing could be gained by remaining
                    longer, and being desirous of getting ahead of the rush, and of getting home as
                    soon as possible, obtained permission to leave the command and bidding good-bye
                    to the comrades of four years turned our faces homeward with sad</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="0012_000244_000203_0047.jpg" xml:id="d3e1298"/>
            <p>45</p>
            <p>hearts. We had the same trouble with the broken railroads returning that we had
                    in going. </p>
            <p>Among those who returned together I can call to mind only Capt. B. F. Peeples,
                    Ensign J. W. Crutchfield, and Lts. N. C. Howard, T. C. Neill and Private Van
                    Thompson.</p>
            <p>At one place while waiting for the train, two deaf and dumb men, from the N. C.
                    Asylum came up on their way home, and wanting to know when the train would leave
                    one of them wrote the question on his slate, he looked around for some one to
                    hand it to, that looked like he would give a civil answer, and selected Capt.
                    Peeples. He could not have made a better selection had he personally known all
                    of us.</p>
            <p>After much walking over several gaps in R. R. between Greensboro and Chester we
                    walked from Chester to Newberry then by rail to Abeville, and walked to
                    Washington, Ga. and by rail to Augusta, where we found U. S. officers sent by
                    Gen. Sherman, to parole all soilders there, and were paroled May 3rd. Went by
                    rail to Atlanta where we found Federal officers sent by Gen. Wilson at Macon.
                    These officers claimed that those at Augusta were acting without proper
                    authority, and they paroled us again. The had a company of dismounted Cavalry
                    sent by rail from Macon, and it looked strange to see them on guard duty while
                    thousands of Confederate soldiers were coming in on the trains, and taking other
                    trains or walking away. </p>
            <p>We walked thence to Dalton (100 miles) over the R. R. that we had destroyed in
                    October 1864. How we wished that it had not been done! At Dalton we took the
                    train to Chattanooga, and then to Nashville. </p>
            <p>At Nashville we with many others were required to take the oath of allegiance to
                    the United States government, before we were allowed to go home. My place in the
                    line was right under the Stars and Stripes, the folds of which almost touched my
                    head as it waved back and forth in the wind. How I loathed it! and what a bitter
                    pill that oath was. We were then asked if we wanted lodging for the night, and
                    when we answered yes, we were told to fall into line, and were marched to the
                    Penitentiary, and put under a shed in an outer enclosure, and slept soundly,
                    having been first given a slice of light-bread and a small piece of boiled meat. </p>
            <p>Next morning as we marched out we were given a slice of light-bread, at the gate,
                    then marched to the Depot, and put aboard the train under guard, to Johnsonville
                    on the Tennessee River, reaching there near sundown, and wishing to gt out of
                    the military lines before anothr day, I hurried to the Provost Marshals office,
                    and secure a pass for us to cross the River. There were seven of us. Lt. N. C.
                    Howard, Van Thompson, J. W. Crutchfield-- myself and a negro. When we were
                    ferried over the river in a skiff. </p>
            <p>After walking two miles, we lay down under some trees in a citizens yard. As soon
                    as it was daylight, next morning we started again. We reached Manlyville at
                    nood. N. C. Howard went to his cousin&apos;s, Mr. Will Wease&apos;s and J. W.
                    Crutchfield took Van Thompson and myeself to his uncle&apos;s, Col. W. E.
                    Travis&apos; for dinneer, and Col. T. furnished Thompson and I a horse each, and
                    Mr. V. one to N. C. Howard to ride home. At Paris we were the first to bring the
                    knowledge of the actual collapse of the Confederate States. </p>
            <pb n="48" facs="0012_000244_000203_0048.jpg" xml:id="d3e1320"/>
            <p>46</p>
            <p>Here Lt. Howard separated from us and Van Thompson and I rode on together.</p>
            <p>At my fathe&apos;s &quot;Double Barn,&quot; by his lane, we saw my father, and
                    &quot;Cousin Robert&quot; (B. Reynolds) standing talking. As we rode up, my
                    father said, &quot;What now?&quot; and I replied &quot;the confederacy is gone
                    up, and I have come home to stay&quot; It was astounding news to both of them,
                    but only too true.</p>
            <p>This was Sunday evening May 14th, 1865. I had been in the Army four years,
                    lacking six days. The best four years of my life. But it was useless to
                    &quot;grieve over spilled milk.&quot; I had come back with unimpaired health,
                    and without any broken bones, and this was worth being thankful for. I spent a
                    week visiting, and resting, and then I began to plan for the future.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 27</p>
            <p>BEGINNING REAL LIFE</p>
            <p>Monday morning May 21st, 1864, I said to my father, &quot;I am ready to go to
                    work at something, what would you advise me to do? &quot;You can go to
                    farming, that is the surest way. Here is pleanty of land, if you eill take
                    charge of the far, you can have all you can make on it above a support for the
                    family.&quot; Everything was paralyzed by the war, and there was no opening for
                    any other business, just then. So I went to work that day. Before the year was
                    out, I told my father that I preferred wages to the undertainty of his proposal,
                    and we settled at ten dollars per month, board and the clothing, mostly for
                    everyday wear, which my mother made me.</p>
            <p>Thus I entered into a farming life virtually under protest, and have kept at it
                    most of my life under protest, and yet it is a pleasant life. Still I have often
                    thought if I had gone West soon after the war and adopted surveying as a
                    profession, where there was plenty to do, I might have done better
                    financially.</p>
            <p>Before leaving home for the war, I had on May 23rd, 1861, secured the consent of
                    Miss Margaret C. Cox, second daughter of Eld. Asa Cox, to become my wife, living
                    three miles N. W. of Paris Tenn. and on January 11th, 1866, we were married.
                    Eld. J. W. Bell, Baptist Minister, who had been sent for failing to be heard
                    from, the ceremony was performed by Rev. J. W. Johnson a Methodist Minister
                    residing near by. The country not having recovered from the devastation of the
                    war, the marriage was a quiet one, only a few persons being present. Mr. T. G.
                    Morris and Mr. W. D. Street acted as groomsmen, and Misses Annie E. Cox, and
                    Mary E. Alexander as bridesmaids.</p>
            <p>After a lunch we drove einght miles to my father&apos;s residence. While passing
                    in sight of the steam mill of Mr. Geo. c. Street, (an uncle of my bride) who was
                    always parital to both of us, he blew his steam whistly as long as one of the
                    vehicles was in view. At my father&apos;s a goodly company of young people had
                    gathered and a merry time was had till a late hour. </p>
            <p>My wife has proved a faithful companion, and help-meet indeed, and has borne me
                    seven children, Eugene Meshech, born April 2nd, 1867; Edwin Hansford Jr.., born
                    March 28th, 1869, John Taliaferry and Joseph Lee, (the latter dying at birth)
                    born July 29th, 1870; Leon Asa, morn July 28th, 1872; Cora Annie, born Sept.
                    17th, 1874; And Maggie Berah born Dec. 3rd, 1876.</p>
            <p>During the year 1866, we lived with my father, and I super-</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="0012_000244_000203_0049.jpg" xml:id="d3e1349"/>
            <p>47</p>
            <p>intended his farm. He furnished his younger sons, William and Thomas, and three
                    negro men to perform the labor, and I receiving one tenth of the crop, and board
                    of my wife, and myself. The year was not a good one, and the newly freed slaves
                    not profitable laor, and it was not remunerative to me. </p>
            <p>In the fall of the year, my father told me that I could build on the East side of
                    his farm near High Hill Church. I moved one of the negro cabins, and built some
                    outhouses, and January 2 1867 we set up housekeeping. Our parents giving us some
                    frniture, the traditional bed, bedstead, and covering, and we bought ten dollars
                    worth including cooking vessels, paying my only five dollars cash, and going in
                    debt for the other five. </p>
            <p>I succeeded only moderately well that year farming. Not having enough fresh land
                    for a full tobaccol crop, I secured the agency of the Collierville Nurseries,
                    from my old teacher Mr. R. B. Keen. Did not succeed so well as I hoped, but
                    secured enough trees to plant me an orchard. </p>
            <p>In 1868 I hired a colored woman Caroline Break, and as she knew how to work the
                    field as well as in the house, she proved a valuable help, and I succeeded
                    better than any year of my life in farming, selling 105 dollars worth of pork,
                    and 130 or more of tobacco, and enough of oats, potatoes and etc to make 300
                    dollars. I purchesed me a set of surveying insturments, having always had a
                    taste of surveying, and secured an appointment as Deputy County Surveyor from my
                    old commander Lt. Col. Wm. C. Swor.</p>
            <p>It is well enough to mention here that on his death in the summer of 1869, I
                    became a candidated for County Surveyor, the office being elective by the
                    magistrates constituting the County Court. I was defeated by Dr. J. W. Lunch,
                    who however said that the good race that I made demanded that he should appoint
                    me deptuy, which he did. I was not much known as a surveyor under Col. Swor, but
                    under Dr. Lynch my acquaintance extended and my work increased, so that when Dr.
                    L. declined re-election I was again a candidate, and was easily elected over my
                    opponents, Capt. J. T. Postlewaite, a Civil engineer and Mr. Jas. Aycock. As I
                    was a sober man and my competitors were not, the magistrates preferred me. After
                    serving more than a year, the financial panic of 1873, had so much reduced the
                    demand for surveying, and my attention being required at home, to overlook my
                    boys, who were not yet old enough to be trusted with managing the farm work
                    alone, I resigned and Rev. Johnson (J. W.) was elected. Seven years later, Mr.
                    J. being supposed to be too sick to recover, I again became a candidate, but the
                    magistrates thought it best to elect the man who willing to accept it when it
                    paid less, and Mr. J. defeated me and it was not in my heart to blame them. </p>
            <p>CHAPTER 28</p>
            <p>MY FATHER&apos;S DEATH AND RESULTS</p>
            <p>In May of 1871, my father died at the age of 65, thus depriving me of a wise
                    counselor. His disease was liver complaint, and he was sick about 10 days. I was
                    appointed Executor by his will, and while his affairs were honestly
                    administered, my want of business tact and experience brought me into no little
                    trouble. Our attorney, Hon. A, H. H. Stuart of Satunton, Va. failing to compel
                    the Administrator of the Estate of my uncle Dr. Taliaferro Rennolds, </p>
            <pb n="50" facs="0012_000244_000203_0050.jpg" xml:id="d3e1371"/>
            <p>48</p>
            <p>to pay over to me 700 dollars of the estate&apos;s assets due my father compelled
                    me to declare the estate insolvent, after most of the debts had been paid in
                    full. This was very humiliating to me. but it could not be helped. At the
                    earnest solicitation of the children of Mr. W. L. Crawford, and thier relatives,
                    all of whom where my fast friends, I had conscented to qualify as guardian for
                    them, which through the malignity and etc of their step-father, Mr. S. B.
                    Hartsfield, and disagreement of attorneys, and incapacity of a drunken County
                    Judge, Jno. W. Harris, I was given a great deal of trouble, but finally after
                    several lawsuits and etc won my case. </p>
            <p>Having a desire to work land less hilly than that which my father gave me, I sold
                    my land in January 1873, for $1,900.00, and purchased land near my
                    father-in-law, 3 1/2 miles from Paris, Tenn. On the Iron Banks Road, buying it
                    of Miss Maggie Alexander for $2,000.00. It was more valuable than the land I
                    sold, but had no dwelling on it. The summer of 1873 was a very dry one, and the
                    crop a still shorter one. </p>
            <p>I improved my place some by erecting a good house, but short crops, low prices
                    and other misfortunes prevented me from being able to pay the last payment on my
                    land, (some of the sale mondy of my other place having been used to build with,
                    and to purchase stock, for hired hands to work,) and borrowing money to pay it,
                    was forced to mortgage my place, and finally had to give it up. In the meantime,
                    my father-in-law gave my wife 80 acres of land on which we resided, there being
                    a small three-room house on it.</p>
            <p>My father-in-law having lost his two youngest daughters in the fall of 1874, we
                    lived in the house with him, during the year 1875. His family consisted of
                    himself, wife and youngest son, (Asa B.). I continued to work my own land, and
                    returned to it at the begining of 1876. In 1882 my father-in-law having moved to
                    Murry, Ky., where he was pastor, we again occupied his house, and cultivated
                    part of his land making the best crop I have ever made. </p>
            <p>During these years my children attended school near by, and part of the time
                    Eugene and Edwin attended the Male Academy at Paris, Tenn. </p>
            <p>Not having sufficient land for my growing family and being unable to earn the
                    money to buy more, I began to look around to see what else I could do, and
                    hearing of the wonderful profits to be made by orange culture in Florida, and
                    the demand for surveyors there, and the balminess of the climate there, I
                    decided that it would be best for me to emigrate there. </p>
            <p>My father-in-law agreed to buy my land, and as soon as my corn was gathered and
                    sold, I started the wagon, with two mules, driven my Mr. Henry Norton, and
                    accompanied by Eugene and Edwin Jr overland to that state. Then as soon as I
                    could sell and deliver my tobacco, and sell my goods and chattles, the others of
                    us started by rail. Mr. and Mrs. A. W. Vinson, and four children, Mr. and Mrs.
                    Frank Clore, and five children, Mr. Levi Jones and son Charlie, Mr. Luther Moore
                    and Hamp Clark (colored) traveled on the same train with us. We left Paris,
                    Tenn. on the morning of Nov. 17th, 1882, and after a very pleasant trip reached
                    Wildwood on the 19th. Spending the night there we took hacks next morning
                    (Sunday) to Leesburg, and put up at the Milam House, our old Capt. J. B. Milam,
                    proprieter.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="0012_000244_000203_0051.jpg" xml:id="d3e1391"/>
            <p>49</p>
            <p>Here we found so many old acquaintances who had preceded us to the &quot;Land of
                    Flowers&quot; that we felt very much at home. Next day we moved out to a house
                    Capt. Milam had rented forus near by, in the country. </p>
            <p>Coming as we did just as the oranges were ripe, and seeing the trees laden with
                    them, and the wagons coming into town loaded with the golden fruit, and
                    everybody seeming prosperous and happy we were delighted with the prospect.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 29</p>
            <p>LIFE IN FLORIDA</p>
            <p>While waiting for my tam and wagon to arrive, I made short trips into the
                    surrounding country to familiarize myself with the new and strange conditions,
                    and to hunt up a suitable place to buy and locate, and the boys and I secured
                    some work packing oranges and etc. Mr. Norton and the boys, with the team and
                    wagon arrived on Dec. 13th, all safe and sound. </p>
            <p>On Dec. 19th, Mr. Norton and I started sout to look at the country. Caried a Mr.
                    Bradley of Woodville, Ohio to Tampa which we reached on the evening of the 21st.
                    Spent the time till the 27th, looking at the country around Mango, Cork and
                    Shiloh, and started back to Leesburg, reaching there on the morning of the 30.
                    After having seen parts of six counties I decided to buy Mr. T. E. Hunter&apos;s
                    80 acres in Sec. 11, T. 19 S. R. 23 E. about 8 miles north of West of Leesburg,
                    and 4 miles S. E. of Wildwood for $750, paying $200.00 in money, $200.00 in one
                    mule and wagon, and notes for the other $350.00, in six, twelve and eighteen
                    months. And on January 5th and 6th, 1883 moved to it, camping in an old house a
                    mile away till we could build a house. </p>
            <p>My wife recieved appointment as teacher of the school (public) one mile north,
                    and commenced teaching Jan. 22nd, John, Leon, Cora and Maggie attending the
                    school, Eugene working for Mr. W. D. Hunter at $10.00 per month, and Ed helping
                    me in the crop and working on the house. On Feb. 3rd we had one room ready to
                    occupy and moved in. </p>
            <p>Not knowing how to cultivate Florida soil, did not make much corn or cotton. Put
                    out two acres or more of orange trees by the side of the two, which were three
                    years old, (or had been set out that long) when I bought the place, also planted
                    a mursery with both sweet and sour orange-seed, from which I not only enlarged
                    my grove, but furnished trees for the boys to plant groves, and also many trees
                    to sell.</p>
            <p>Worked on the house of three room as time could be spared from the crop, and by
                    latter part of March could use it all, and later built outhouses. The boys
                    having slept in Tom Hunter&apos;s log homestead house till mine was finished, and
                    again later on. I took contract to build house for Mr. Will Venable, living near
                    by. and worked on it with the boy&apos;s help, in the summer.</p>
            <p>In September Mrs. R. and I had attacks fo fever, but not serious, and yet more
                    serious than any sickness we had afterwords. Late in the fall, (the Fla.
                    Southern R. R. having been built,) L. B. Lee and J. F. Mclendon, 8 miles north
                    of Leesburg. This introduced me to the people of that vicinity and during the
                    next two years I surveyed most of the land for four or five miles around </p>
            <pb n="52" facs="0012_000244_000203_0052.jpg" xml:id="d3e1418"/>
            <p>50</p>
            <p>that village. I usually had two or three of my sons to assist me, and soon had
                    them so well trained that I could do much more work, than with my raw hands. Wej
                    recieved seven to eight dollar per day, and camping out in unoccupied homestead
                    houses genrally, we did our own cooking. The weather usually being fine, with
                    but little rain, and the land open pine woods interspersed with clear lakes we
                    enjoyed the work very much.</p>
            <p>Monday morning we would have a lot of bread cooked up, and putting our equipments
                    and camping outfit in a one-horse wagon, we would hitch our one-eyed mule (tobe)
                    to it, and start out for the week, usually not returning till Saturday night,
                    and resting till Monday morning. </p>
            <p>During the summer we would work up the grove and make a small crop on what land
                    was cleared. In 1884-5 and 6 we raised and shipped vegetables, squashes,
                    tomatoes, cucumbers, cantaloupes and melons. The grove was enlarged till had
                    about eight acres, and the boys one or two each. </p>
            <p>In winter 1883 and 4 Miss Lily Cloud taught the Lake Deaton School and boarded
                    with us for awhile. In winter of 1884 and 5 Mrs. R. taught again, and later Miss
                    Tallullah Atkins taught several sessions. The school meanwhile being
                    consolidated with the one at Orange Home Depot 1 1/2 miles S. W. on F. C. and P.
                    R. R. (now S. A. L. R. W. ) </p>
            <p>By 1886 the orange boom began to quiet down and the emigration very much
                    decreased. Previous to this I did much surveying around Chetwynd, Bamboo,
                    Whitney, Wildwood, Orange Home, Colemen asn some at various other places. When
                    the demand for surveying had been much reduced, it was necessary for the boys to
                    seek other employment, as as they could not all be profitably employed at home,
                    they secured jobs elsewhere, opening up land, planting and cultivating groves,
                    budding nursery tree, cultivating vegetables farming etc, which was the
                    beginning of a separation which has resulted in scattering them very widely. </p>
            <p>In October 1887, Hunter L Wilson, my wife&apos;s nephew, came to Florida, and
                    decided to engage in orange culture, and John sold him five acres of the land I
                    had given him, and arranged for me to board Hunter, and for Hunter&apos;s
                    father, (Col. J. D. Wilson) to board John, at Winchester, Tenn. (his home) where
                    John could attend the Normal School there, and he has ever since remained in
                    Tenn. studying and teaching till his graduation, and teaching since his
                    graduation and he is at this writing (August 1900) Principal of the Winchester
                    Public School. In December 1898, he married Miss Leila Erwin of Winchester. </p>
            <p>In the fall of 1885, I purchased an interest in a saw mill at Bamboo, with
                    Messrs. Dan. Wilson, and Ben Wynns and sons as partners, and moved it to Dundee,
                    6 miles north of Leesburg on the Fla. Southern R. W. where we operated it for a
                    year. My sister Jennie with her husband, W. S. Martin and children having come
                    to fla. in Oct. 1885, lived at Dundee, Eugene and Ed boarding with them, and
                    they and Mr. Martin helping to operate the mill. They returned to Tenn. in the
                    Spring of 1886. When I sold my interest in the mill perhaps in the fall of 1886,
                    my sons returned home. </p>

            <p>CHAPTER 30</p>
            <p>FREEZE OF 1894 and 5 AND RESULTS</p>
            <p>On the nights of December 28th and 29th, 1894 a heavy freeze injured the orange
                    trees. By Feb. 7th following the trees had to put out a vigorous growth, and
                    were full of sap, and on the nights of Feb. 7th and 8th another severe freeze
                    killed to the ground all the orange trees, except the extreme southern part of
                    the state, and a few others here and there. These freezes were followed by
                    others somewhat less severe a few years later, which pretty well exterminated
                    all the trees north of Manatee, DeSoto and Lee Counties. This heavy loss caused
                    an almost complete change in the economic conditions of a large part of the
                    State, and a great many people deserted their dead groves, and sought other
                    localities to secure the means of livilihood. </p>
            <p>In the spring of 1895, John and Leon made arrangement for their Mother to visit
                    her parents, John and others in Tenn. and about May 1st she left for that State
                    remaining several weeks. A few days later the State Board of Missions of Florida
                    Baptist Con. secure for me a pass over the F. C. and P. R. R. and Southern R. R.
                    to Washington City to attend the Southern Baptist Con. and paid my fare thence
                    to Phildelphia. New York City and Hamilton N. Y. to copy records from minutes of
                    Florida Baptist Associations held by American Baptist Historical Society and
                    Samuel Colgate Hist. Collections. </p>
            <p>Had congenial companions to Washington, where I stopped with my cousin&apos;s
                    Maria, Belvidere and Virginia Hansford, who kept a boarding house at 241 N.
                    Capitol St. only half a block from the Capitol grounds, enjoying my visit there.
                    Enjoyed also the Convention as it was the only one I ever attended of the whole
                    South. Also enjoyed seeing the sights of Washington, the most beautiful city in
                    our country. I went on the Philadelphia, and copied the minutes there, visiting
                    Independence Hall, and other interesting places, and then to New York, and up
                    the Hudson Valley on the N. Y. Central and H. R. R. R. viewing the Palisades,
                    Highland, Catskill Mts. and Mohawk Valley to Hamilton, N. Y. Returning to New
                    York City, I went to Orange, N. J. to the home of Bro. Samuel Colgate, where I
                    copied such minutes as we had no duplicates of and enjoying the hospitality,
                    remaning two days. Then returning to the City spent a day and a half visiting
                    Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge, Green Wood Cemetary and etc. Having exchanged
                    passes with Bro. L. D. Geiger, I took the Clyde Steamship, Iriquois and had a
                    pleasant voyage to Jacksonville, Never having seen the Ocean, it was a great
                    treat to spent two and a half days upon it, especially as I had no sea-sickness.
                    My trip was robber of much of its enjoyment by the want of a congenial
                    travelling companion, want of more means for expenses, and of more time, as I
                    could not help thinking of my two daughters left at home, although I had left
                    them in good hands, with Miss Sophia Sheppard to Keep them company, and Bro. M.
                    M. Bean and Mr. Sam Tyner to protect them at night.</p>
            <p>Till september 1898 I managed to make a living for my small family by farming,
                    doing small jobs and surveying, looking after lands of non-residents and etc. My
                    youngest son Leon Asa became of age July 29th, 1893, after which there were none
                    to help me,</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="0012_000244_000203_0054.jpg" xml:id="d3e1456"/>
            <p>52</p>
            <p>and &quot;every row was mine&quot; as it was at the first. Our eldest daughter,
                    Cora A. married Mr. Fred. C. Markert of Wildwood, June 21st, 1896 and two years
                    later the youngest Maggie B. married Mr. Reuben D. Mathews, June 29th, 1898. </p>
            <p>Thus there was no one to keep Mrs. R. company in my absence, except the two year
                    old grand-daughter Ella Hansford, whose mother had died when she was two weeks
                    old, and who had been committed by her dying mother to her grandmother&apos;s
                    care with the approval of her father, our second son Edwin H. Jr. </p>
            <p>When I bought the orange grove, I knew that half of it was on land belonging to
                    the F. C. and P. R. R. Co. The extension of the grove had been mainly on this
                    also, but when it came on the market, I purchased it for $200. paying half cash
                    and giving my note for the other half, which had been increased to $175, which I
                    was unable to pay without encumbering the place, and as it became necessary to
                    pay I borrowed $500.00 and mortgaged the place, being in need of funds to pay
                    other debts, and properly fertilize the grove. Six months later the freeze
                    ruined the grove, and destroayed the hope of being able to redeem the place, and
                    thus leaving us homeless. I now began to look around for some other place to
                    live, where I could have a better opportunity to provide the necessaries of
                    life. </p>
            <p>CHAPTER 31</p>
            <p>REMOVAL TO JACKSONVILLE</p>
            <p>When my sceond son Edwin H. Jr. learned that I was planning a move, he wrote me
                    suggesting that I come to Jacksonville where he was employed at the bakery of
                    Loren Stein, so that he could have his little girl near him, and after visiting
                    Jacksonville and looking over the surroundings, we rented a house on the S. E.
                    corner of Adams, No. 1202 E. Adams and Van Buren Streets at $10. per month, he
                    agreeing to pay half the expenses, including rent, water, provisions and etc. </p>
            <p>I then closed out my business at &quot;Myrtle Vale&quot; (as we called the
                    place), selling what we could and giving away what we could not sell, and on
                    sept. 1st, 1898, moved to Jacksonville.</p>
            <p>After having lived nearly 59 years in the country it was not an easy thing to
                    adjust myself to the new conditions. The rush and hurry, the want of quiet,
                    unobserved surrounding, the unconcern of most of the people, whether you lived
                    or died, whether you had the necessaries of life or starved, for want of them,
                    the jealousy of those in business towards any one entering the same kind of
                    business, being strangers to our nearest neighbors, the proximity of a saloon,
                    and all the evils that accompany it, and the seeming difference even in the
                    religious life of the city from that of the country, these and many other things
                    had to become familiarized, before one could feel at home. </p>
            <p>But I finally became used to these things, and settled down to real life. But how
                    to make a living, was the question of the hour. I tried collecting physicians
                    bills for Dcotors R. H. Dean, Miller and Cloud and others, but I soon found that
                    those who were willing to pay, responded to notices sent through the mail, and
                    those to whom a collector had to be sent, were either unable or unwilling to pay
                    or both. So I quit that.</p>
            <p>I tried selling patent medicines for the Economic Medicine</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="0012_000244_000203_0055.jpg" xml:id="d3e1483"/>
            <p>53</p>
            <p>Co of Paris, Tenn. but found it slow business to introduce new medicines, where
                    dozens of others had already occupied the field. So I had to abandon that. </p>
            <p>The lot on which the house we rented stood, had about one fifth of an acre of
                    land enclosed. This was rich river-bottom land, and after ditching and bedding
                    it, I planted it in vegetables, principally for our own use, selling the
                    surplus. By studying the soil, the demands of the market, and learning how to
                    peddle them, in an ordinary market-basket from house to house, I succeeded in
                    finding a sale for all I could raise at a fair remuneration and thus kept the
                    wolf from the door. I never liked &quot;peddling&quot;, and was unused and
                    unqualified for it but &quot;practice makes perfect,&quot; and offering only
                    good vegetables I soon had no trouble in securing customers, and made many warm
                    friends, who helped me to extend my trade. I sometimes acted as night-watchman
                    at Bro. Loren Stein&apos;s bakery, did odd jobs of carpentering, a little
                    surveying, and thus pieced out my slender income. </p>
            <p>In the fall of 1898, and also 1899, having a pass over the lines of the F. C. and
                    P. R. R. as Historical Secretary of Florida Baptist Convention, I visited
                    several of the Associations, and small collections at these meetings helped my
                    exchequer some also. During the summer and fall of 1899 I preached once a month
                    at Sanderson, Fla. and a few dollars more was received.</p>
            <p>As I walked the streets of Jacksonville, with a basket of vegetables on each arm,
                    I often thought, &quot;I am capable of doing something better than this,&quot;
                    when later, I became Chaplain of the State Senate, and stood before that
                    prpresentative body, I felt, I could say, &quot;ar last I have found the
                    something better.&quot;</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 32</p>
            <p>BURNING OF JACKSONVILLE</p>
            <p>On May 3rd, 1901 I helped to clear away the dinner table, and went upstairs to
                    take my usual siesta. About 130 P. M. my wife called me, and said dense black
                    smoke was rising from the whole western part of the city, and passers-by said
                    that the whole of that part of the city was burning. A look out the window
                    convinced me that the fire was no small affair. I told my wife that I would go
                    and see what the danger to us was. She asked me not to stay long, and I promised
                    I would not. Reaching the car line on Florida Avenue, (a block away) I found the
                    cars standing still, the current having failed from trouble with the machinery. </p>
            <p>Not knowing how long the delay might last I decided to walk ahead, and took the
                    shortest way along Adams St. The day was very warm for the season, and I soon
                    realized that I must take it leisurely to keep from getting overheated, and I
                    feared taht I might need all my strength to save my household goods. </p>
            <p>At Laura Street I turned North to the Park and diagonally N. W. through it. At
                    the hemming monument I saw the first fire refugees, some ladies with a few
                    things in their arms and their faces so warm that the blood seemed almost ready
                    to gush out. At Hogan I turned West on Dubval. At Julia the people were wetting
                    the roofs and porches of their houses, on the south side of Duval, a little
                    further on the fire men were fighting the fire on north side, as the wind
                    blowing them from south-west I thought the</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="0012_000244_000203_0056.jpg" xml:id="d3e1509"/>
            <p>54</p>
            <p>fire would be kept north of Duval. I walked a block further to Cedar, and looking
                    south I saw that a house on north-west corner of Cedar and monroe was on fire. I
                    went down there and men were fighting the fire on north side of roof, with
                    prospece of success, but I noticed that the south side of roof was on fire, and
                    soon decided that it was beyond control, and that another swath, a block or more
                    wide was doomed. I walked east on Monroe to Hogan and north on Hogan near the
                    corner of the Park and I saw Bro. G. E. Chase cross in front of me rolling a
                    child&apos;s carriage, piled up with children&apos;s cloaks, gloves and etc,
                    which I learned later containd Bro. Hobson&apos;s silverware. In front of the
                    Baptist Church, I met Bro. D. T. Daughtry, and we discussed the chances of the
                    church&apos;s escape, both thinking it safe. Bro. E. E. Cleaveland was standing
                    in his porch directing the removal of his furniture. At south east corner of
                    Hogan and Ashley some men were bringing Bro. D. C. Audress&apos; piano down the
                    stairway. The Ebenzer M. E. C. (col) across Ashley St. was a mass of flames, and
                    the wind now blowing fiercely tore the burning shingles off. and sent them
                    flying through the air towards the east. I turned west on south side of Ashley
                    and looked across Ashley to Dr. Williams house near the middle of the block, and
                    in which Bro. W. A. Hobson our pastor lived. The rear of the building was in
                    flames, some household goods were piled on the sidewalk in front, and some
                    persons standing about but no one I knew. (Bro. Hobson and family had gone on an
                    excursion up the St. John&apos;s River) </p>
            <p>Seeing I could be of no use, the fire being very hot on south side of St. I
                    turned back, and went down Church Stl to Main, and down Main to Ed&apos;s Lunch-room,
                    which I found closed. I afterwards found out he was in cook-room packing things
                    to move. I then turned up Adams for home. I noticed a building at corner of
                    Church and Ocean on fire, and further n the roof of the Catholic Church was in
                    flames at Church and Newman, and I knew that everything to Hogan&apos;s Creek was
                    doomed unless the wind should change. I stopped at Cora&apos;s, found Fred had
                    just come from the store and we talked over the situation. Then I went home, and
                    told Mrs. R. the prospect. After resting awhile I walked down to the Duval St.
                    Viaduct, I found that the fire had spread and advanced, and the whole hillside
                    on the west side of Hogan&apos;s Creek was one sheet of roaring, surging flames.
                    But I was convinced that the lateness of the hour, the want of fuel to feed on,
                    and the absence of anything loose about the viaduct, would likely prevent
                    further advance there. At Adams St. the shingle-mill had to be closely watched,
                    and I helped other put out the fire when the bark and etc caught, and a bucket
                    brigade kept a small house from catching and thus stopped its advance. At Bay
                    St. the tinroofed houses, the wide R. R. right of way, the work of the colored
                    firemen, and the lulling of the wind, and change of direction stopped it there.
                    I came home about sundown. Just as supper was over I heard a great roaring, saw
                    showers of flying parks and found on hurrying down Bay St., that it was the
                    rosen stored in the A. V. and W. warehouse on the River near St. Cctherine St.
                    which had caught fire. Though looking very dangerous only a few small places on
                    roofs in east Jacksonvill caught and these were easily extinguished, and so the
                    fire ended. </p>
            <p>Ed saved the most of his stock and fixtures by moving them</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="0012_000244_000203_0057.jpg" xml:id="d3e1521"/>
            <p>55</p>
            <p>several times, on hand trucks, and finally putting them on a lighter, which the
                    owner had towed over the River. </p>
            <p>Next day, Saturday I went down to see the ruins, and wrote cards to our relaties
                    to assure themn of our safety. Found that Gov. Jennings had ordered several
                    companies of State Troops here, and put the city under &quot;Martial Law.&quot;
                    A wise conclusion. Col. C. P. Lovell was put in command. He closed all the
                    saloons, and had the city throughly patrolled. </p>
            <p>On Sunday Ed secured a hack, and he, Mrs. McClintock, Mrs. R. and Ella and I
                    drove over to Riverside Park, where Bro. Hobson had through the daily papers
                    invited the Baptists to meet. Finding the Campellites had selected the same
                    place we held a joint service. </p>
            <p>Ed commenced on May 11th to reconstruct a Lunch Car for his business. Various
                    hinderances prevented its completion for nearly a month. When finished, he put
                    it on Laura St. near Bay, and did a pretty good business, till about Sept. 16th
                    when a careless negro cook spilled gasoline on a hot stove and burned it so as
                    to ruin it. I helped him and others to construct it. </p>
            <p>He found employment at Sprill&apos;s cold-drink stand at Opera House and when the Sims
                    building was ready for occupancy, secured store-room at 210 Main St. two doors
                    from his old stand, fitted it up handsomely and on Feb. 1st. 1902, opened for
                    business. </p>
            <p>I find I have neglected to mention marriage of my sones; Edwin H. Jr., married
                    Miss S. Ella Mobley of Adamsville, Fla., Febuary---1892 Eugene married Miss
                    Ellen Cook of Center hill, Florida, 1896 John married Miss Leila Erwin of
                    Winchester, Tenn. 1898 and Leon married Miss Ervina Johns of Starke, Fla.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 33</p>
            <p>MY RELIGIOUS LIFE</p>
            <p>When a little over 4 years old I mischievously threw a peach stone at my
                    mother&apos;s mirror, and when she came into the room, and saw what was done, I
                    told her that my brother, John (2 1/2) years old) did it. The thought of this my
                    first (and almost my only false-hood) produced conviction of sin, and I was
                    never able to fully shake it off. When 14 years old my conviction took strong
                    hold of me at High Hill Church one mile from my father&apos;s residence. It was
                    the last night of a protracted meeting, and on going forward to be prayed for, I
                    found myself sitting by the side of my brother John. The pastor, Eld. Isac C.
                    Coker, mentioned that tow sone of Brother Rennolds had come forward. I stifled
                    my conviction and though occasionally going forward when &quot;mourners were
                    called&quot;, I made little progress heavenward, Satan usually snatching away
                    the good seed sown in my heart. I entered the Army at 21 1/1 unsaved. When a
                    battle came on the fear of death, produced the fear of death, and I called on
                    God for protection, but when the battle was over, the subject was dismissed. </p>
            <p>When the war closed, and I saw its disastrous results, I began to consider how
                    uncertain were all things earthly, and there came a longing for something sure
                    and certain. A revival wave swept over the country, but it did not take deep
                    enough hold on me</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="0012_000244_000203_0058.jpg" xml:id="d3e1548"/>
            <p>56</p>
            <p>God gave me a christian wife, and though I was living what was recognized by
                    others a moral life, my wife&apos;s quiet, trustful, --------devotion was a
                    living rebuke to me, and the Spirit use it to bring pungent conviction of sin. </p>
            <p>During the last week in September 1868, a revival meeting was in progress at
                    Birds Creek Church (5 miles away from home.) One morning during the meeting Bro.
                    James H. Chiles Sr. came over to my house before breakfast, meeting me at the
                    stable-lot, he said to me after the usual salutations that a brother sister of
                    my wife&apos;s had been converted at the Birds Creek meeting and would be
                    baptized that day, and that himself and wife would come by for Mrs. R. if she
                    wished to go. He then added &quot;Ed it is time you were thinking of these
                    things.&quot; The words went like an arrow to my heart, and Were indeed
                    &quot;seed sown in good ground.&quot;</p>
            <p>Two weeks later a protracted meeting commenced at High Hill Church, less than
                    half a mile from my home. I attended on Sunday, (Oct. 13th) and again at night,
                    my wife could not well go at night our first child (Eugene) being only a few
                    months old. I went to work Monday morning, but attended church at night. While
                    fixing my collar for me, my wife made some remark about my duty spiritually, and
                    it was as a dagger to my already striken heart. My father-in-lay, Eld. Asa Cox,
                    pastor of the church was conducting the meeting, and during his prayer
                    preceeding the sermon, I became so deeply convicted of sin, I determined that as
                    soon as it was over I would go forward, and ask to be prayed for, without
                    waiting for the sermon. But this determination quieted me somewhat, and I kept
                    my seat till the invitation was extended after the sermon, when I promptly went
                    forward with several others. My excitement was very high at first but it quieted
                    down soon. As was the custom in those days the pastor and others talked to me,
                    but though I had repented I did not exercise faith. </p>
            <p>I attended church Tuesday, and Tuesday night, going to the &quot;mourner&apos;s
                    bench&quot; each time but making no progress seemingly towards saving faith. </p>
            <p>On Wednesday morning as I sat at the breakfast table in the log cabin, used as a
                    cook and dining-room in the back yard at home while I thought and talked to my
                    wife about my condition I was enabled to lay hold of Christ by faith, and my
                    heart was filled with joy, and I exclaimed &quot;this must be the Lord&apos;s
                    work. Satan has been working with me for a long time, bu he has never made me
                    feel this way.&quot; From that hour to this I have never had a moments doubt of
                    my regeneration. That day there was baptizing near Bro. R. M. Jobe&apos;s which
                    I attended, and on the way to the Church, as I looked over the old red hills, a
                    landscape I looked at a thousand times before, it seemed to me the most
                    beautiful scene I had ever beheld. </p>
            <p>After the sermon that day, I did not respond to the invitation to go forward and
                    be prayed for, I felt to happy to need it. After dismission Bro. James R. Chiles
                    Sr. came to me, and pointing Bro. Joe Crawford who was standing near by, said
                    &quot;don&apos;t you love Bro. Crawdord and me better than you ever did ?&quot;
                    I replied, &quot;I certainly do. &quot;Then you are saved, he said, &quot;for
                    by this shall you know that you have passed from death unto life, if ye love the
                    bretheren.&quot; My aunt Sallie Rennolds, seeing me weeping and yet looking
                    happy, came up and said &quot;Edwin, have you found the pearl of great
                    price,&quot; and I answered, &quot;I hope so.&quot;</p>

            <p>57</p>
            <p>On Saturday night I with several others joined the church, my wife being one, and
                    on Sunday morning I was baptized with other, by my father-in-law, Eld. Asa Cox,
                    and today the view in memory is bright of that scened that lovely Oct. (20th)
                    day, with the quiet stream flowing along, with its surface dotted with the
                    yellow maple leaves, and on the bank, the little crowd standing, among them
                    wife, father, mother, brothers, sisters, friends and neighbors. </p>
            <p>That day a &quot;young men&apos;s prayer meeting&quot; was organized, including
                    about a dozen young men and boys, myself amond the number. And the meeting
                    closed. When we met the next Wednesday night, all looked from one to another and
                    wished some one else would make a start. I had some experience in public debatin
                    and etc and I took the Bible, read a chapter and tried to pray, several hymns
                    were sung and interspersed with prayers by others. I had already commenced
                    family worship, perhapts Monday night. The P. M. met regularly, sometimes in the
                    winter when the weather was bad not more than six would be present. All grew in
                    grace, and after awhile the doors were opened to all who would come. </p>
            <p>I became impressed with the thought that there was something for me to do in the
                    Master&apos;s Kingdom. Finally in Feb. 1869 (I think) I told the church my
                    feelings, and they decided to license me to preach and did so. I commenced my
                    feeble efforts at the prayer meetings, and gradually extended them to other
                    churches, but it seemed to me to make little progress. I was sent to the Asso.
                    in 1868 as messenger and selected to assist in reading the chruch letters. At
                    the Union meeting in 1869, I was elected Secretary, and at the Asso. in the fall
                    elected Asst. Clerk. I continued to fill these positions for most of the time I
                    remained in Tenn. </p>
            <p>In the summer of 1870, my cousin Richard B. Rennolds, (who had been licensed
                    after I was ) and myself were called to ordination. On the 2nd Sunday in Sept.
                    the prebytery met at High Hill Church and ordained us. My father and
                    father-in-law and Bro. J. W. Bell, and one or two more constituted it. Bro. Bell
                    preached the sermon. I continued to preach as opportunity offered, but with some
                    misgivings as to whether I had not missed my calling. While I had faith in
                    God&apos;s accomplishing his plan of evangelizing the world I did not have a
                    clear view of the part I was to perform. I received no call as pastor, though
                    there were pastorledd churches. I could see no visible results of my efforts. So
                    after about 6 years I told the Church how I felt about it and asked them to
                    release me from the obligation to preach, which they reluctantly did. </p>
            <p>I served as clerk of the Asso. (Western District) in 1874. Having moved 8 miles
                    away from the church in 1873, I found it too inconvenient so I removed my
                    membership to Paris church, where I was elected clerk and deacon. But as I
                    preferred a country church where I changed my membership to Birds Creek. While
                    my wife and I were members at Paris, our eldest son Eugene M. was converted at a
                    revival held by the pastor, Bro. W. C. Grace, and assisted by Dr. W. A. Nelson,
                    and he was baptized by Bro. Grace. </p>
            <p>When I removed to Sumter Co. Florida in Nov, 1882, and settled 1 1/2 miles N. E.
                    of Orange Home, I found myself six miles from the nearest Baptist Church. Some
                    of the neighbors, in the spring of 1883 asked me to superintend a union Sunday
                    School, at Lake Deaton School House, one mile north of my residence, This I </p>
            <pb n="60" facs="0012_000244_000203_0060.jpg" xml:id="d3e1584"/>
            <p>58</p>
            <p>did for a few weeks, but the interest soon slackened till but few besides my own
                    family attended, when I decided that it would be best to have Bible study in my
                    own family on Sunday morning, till an opportunity opened to attend a Baptist S.
                    S.</p>
            <p>In Nov. 1883, Mrs. R., Eugene and myself united with Equity (now Lady Lake)
                    Church. In Dec. 1883, a church was organized at what is not Whitney Station on
                    the S. A. L. R. R. and in July 1884 we moved our membership there. I was at once
                    recognized as Deacon elected clerk, and also Superintendent of the S. S. and
                    teacher of the Bible Class, serving also as Trustee, and Treasurer. </p>
            <p>Here I seemed to have found the work intended for me to do, and my efforts seemed
                    to be highly appreciated by the church and its pastors, W. J. Huges, A. E.
                    Cloud, L. D. Geiger, B. M. Bean, T. W. Spicer, and R. Lovell. </p>
            <p>In October 1884, I was elected Clerk of the Alachua Asso. and re-elected annually
                    till 1898, when I removed from its bounds. I became interested in the history of
                    the Asso. andat the request of several brethren, I began collection of materials
                    to write it up. I found that as the Asso. originally occupided all the territory
                    East of the Swanee River, now covered by fifteen other Associations, that its
                    history would involve a record of much of their past, and that it would be
                    better that a history of all the Associations in the State be written in one
                    volume. I suggested it to the Associations that the matter be laid before the
                    State Convention, which was done. The Convention agreed to take up the work, and
                    I was elected historical Secretary, with instructions to report to the State
                    Board of Missions. Since then I have given much time to the work as I could, and
                    have received some Compensation. I have found it a labor of love. I have visited
                    nearly all the Associations in the State, some of them several times. and have
                    collected much material, and my labors have been warmly commended by many of the
                    brethren and sisters. In the years 1898 and 1899, passes were given me and I
                    visited Union Meeting and Associations without cost. </p>
            <p>At the session of the Convention held in Lake City, in Jan. 1893, I was elected
                    Asst. Rec. Sec. which position I have held till the present date, 1902. </p>
            <p>In while Bro. Bean, my pastor was preaching from the word &quot;Mary&quot; John
                    20th Chapter and 16th verse, and dwelling on the idea that whoever has a message
                    ought to be faithful to deliver it, I became impressed with the thought that I
                    was not delivering my message, and at the next meeting a month, I told the
                    church of my feelings and they secured a record of my ordination, from High Hill
                    Church Tenn. and restored to me authority to preach. I at once commenced
                    preaching once a month at Whitney, continueing to act as superintendent and
                    preached at such places as I could reach. Since my removal to Jacksonville I
                    have preached at Union Meetings and Associations and occasionally at other
                    places, and have supplied in Jacksonville for Bros. Parsons and Hobson, when
                    they were absent.</p>
            <p>In December 1901, I was elected Pastor at Bethany, Nassau Co. and have preached
                    for them till this date, Sept. 1902. </p>
            <p>My preaching is so different from the kind which they have been accustomed to
                    hearing, that I felt that I was not reaching them, and as I was unused to
                    regular preaching that it was a great task for awhile, but gradually I was
                    enabled to secure self-confi-</p>

            <p>dence, and so enjoy the work. At the September meeting, Bro. D. Sikes came and
                    preached till Thursday, and much interest was aroused. Three young men, Hilliard
                    Jones, and Wade and David Sauls, and four young ladies, Mabel, Myrtle and Minnie
                    Sauls were baptized. </p>
            <p>CHAPTER 34</p>
            <p>RENEWAL OF AUTOBIOGRAPHY APRIL 18TH 1911</p>
            <p>After a long interval of rest I, today, take up the thread of my life and bring
                    it up to date. </p>
            <p>At the close of the protracted meeting, mentioned above, I was notified that Bro.
                    Sikes had been called as pastor and thus ended my first atempt at a pastorate.
                    It was a great shock to me, but I accepted it as the Lord&apos;s doing. </p>
            <p>In October 1903, I was elected Pastor at Macedonia (now Dinsmore.) My experience
                    here was about the same as at Bethany and a year later, the church called
                    another pastor and so for only two years of my ministerial life, have I been
                    pastor. Since that time I have only preached as occasion offered. </p>
            <p>Though I do not doubt my call to preach, I at the same time think it was not
                    intended that I should be engaged in regular pastorial work.</p>
            <p>CHAPLAIN OF THE FLORIDA SENATE</p>
            <p>I have always preferred praying to preaching, I had rather talk to God than to
                    people. So at the assembling of the Florida Legislature in April 1903, I sought
                    the position of Chaplain of the Florida Senate. I had two opponents, but was
                    elected on the first ballot, receiving, 18 votes out of 31. My gray hairs and my
                    &quot;Confederate Cross of Honor,&quot; no doubt helped much in securing this
                    honor. The new wings of the Capitol addition, had just been completed and so I
                    had the honor of offering the first prayer in the new Senate Chamber in the
                    South wing of the State House. </p>
            <p>The remembrance of the service of my maternal grandfather, (Theodosius Hansford)
                    as clerk of the Senate of Virginia, 1800 to 1825, and of my uncle (Addison
                    Hansford,) 1825 to 1850 and of the desire of my mother that I, her first born
                    and best loved child, should at some time be honored by serving in prominent
                    public station, has added zest to the pleasure it has afforded me to represent
                    my Master, before the people&apos;s representatives. And it has given me more
                    joy to be an &quot;Ambassador of Christ,&quot; than a representative of the
                    people. </p>
            <p>My salary was only $100.00 but I managed to save about $40. of it and decided to
                    visit my old home in Tenn. and secure more data for a history of Henry County&apos;s
                    soldiery in the Civil War. </p>
            <p>So I left home in June and returned home -------- I enjoyed the trip very much. </p>
            <p>Sept. 1sr, 1902 we rented and moved to No. 44 E. 5th St. where we lived till
                    March 1904, when we rented and moved to 101 E. 7th St. In May 1908, Ed bought
                    half interest in the house at 2219 Hubbard St. and in March 1910 he sold it and
                    bought a house at 515 E. 5th St. where we now reside. </p>
            <p>During my stay in Tallahassee I had drafted a rough outline of my History, and on
                    returning from Tenn. in 1903, I had worked assidiously at revising and rewriting
                    it. To get the rolls of the various companies, even approximately correct,
                    entailed much </p>
            <pb n="62" facs="0012_000244_000203_0062.jpg" xml:id="d3e1641"/>
            <p>60</p>
            <p>labor and more thought. </p>
            <p>At the session of the State Baptist Convention at Lake City in January 1903,
                    which place I have since filled by continuous re-election. I have felt fitted
                    specially for this postion and have done some of the hardest work of my life to
                    fill its satisfactorily.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER 35</p>
            <p>Preparation, Publication and Sale of my History of Henry Commands in the
                    Confederate States Army.</p>
            <p>I had from the close of the Civil War, desired to see a history of Henry
                    County&apos;s gallant soldiery written. When it became evident that if it was
                    written, I must do it, I applied myself to the task. In many respects I was
                    prepared for it. By nature I was given a fine memory. I enlisted early and saw
                    (with small exceptions) all of the service in which my command participated, I
                    had training for collecting and arranging data. And I knew where to hunt for the
                    material to fill the gaps in my own knowledge. Then my heart was in it. As
                    Secretary of the Florida Baptist Convention I was enabled to get R. R. tickets
                    for ads. in the minutes and this enabled me to visit Tenn. in 1904-5 and 6.</p>
            <p>So I attended the Southern Baptist Convention at Nashville, Tenn. in May 1904 and
                    spent a month in West Tenn. gathering the final material for my book. About the
                    middle of June I returned to Nashville and attended the Southern Baptist
                    convention and then home. I at once made arrangements with the Sun Publishing
                    Co. to print my book and with the H. and W. B. Drew to bind it, prepared the M.
                    S. and watched its printing, reading every page of the proof and in August had
                    the pleasure of seeing it come from the bindry. My wife in the meantime had gone
                    on a visit to our relaties in Tenn. and wrote me not to wait for her to return. </p>
            <p>Upon which I started out to sell the book, going via, Chattanooga, Memphis, Union
                    City, Hickman, and Fulton Ky. and Martin, Tenn. to Paris, Tenn. My schoolmate
                    Pleas. J. Diggs, loaned me a horse for a week and I vanvassed the N. E. part of
                    the County and then along the R. R. walking from Springville to the Methodist
                    Camp-Meeting at Manly&apos;s Chapel, remaining from Saturday to Monday, then
                    continueing my walk to Mr. McCullough&apos;s and spent the night, was taken with
                    a chill durring the night, so slight as not to recognize it. Next mornin felt
                    too weak to go to Mansfield, so turned my steps towards my father-in-laws, about
                    six miles, towards Paris, riding a little in a buggy. The second night I had a
                    chill, which was unmistakable. I had suffered from an attack of indigestion, a
                    year before (Oct. 1903) but this second attack was much more severe than the
                    first and for the first two days the result was in doubt. </p>
            <p>An old friend Dr. I. A. McSwain was called in and his skill had much to do with
                    my recovery. The nausea was so great that I dared not turn over, or move much to
                    even brush the pestilant flies away. The second day, all unexpectedly, my eldest
                    daughter, Cora stepped into the door with her baby, (my first namesake,) in her
                    arms and presently her husband and two elder children. They were on their way
                    back to florida from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I felt then that I was sure of the
                    careful nursing, I so much needed</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="0012_000244_000203_0063.jpg" xml:id="d3e1663"/>
            <p>61</p>
            <p>and which my aged father-in-law and his wife could not give. I suffered much in
                    body and much more in mind. </p>
            <p>The publication of my book seemed in response to the leading of Providence. Five
                    friends, (A. B. White, Dr. S. H. caldwell, A. A. Miller, Dr. J. T. Irion, P. J.
                    Diggs, R. P. diggs, Maj. S. C. Cooper, Jno. T. Upchurch, and C. W. Kennerly,)
                    had indorsed my note in bank for $600.00 to enable me to publish it. I felt like
                    I could not die content and leave them to pay the amount. So I besought God to
                    spare me till I had sold enough to pay cost of publication and he mercifully
                    answered my plea fo restoration to health. </p>
            <p>When I had convalesced sufficiently to stand the trip home, I accompanied my
                    children to Fla.</p>
            <p>The balmy climate of Florida and God&apos;s mercy, enabled me to regain strength,
                    and when spring, or early summer, returned, I went back to Tenn. going by way of
                    Louisville, Ky. where I attended the U. C. V. Reunion, coming back as far as
                    Chattanooga, going thence to West Point (Tenn.) via Tuscumbia, Ala. where I
                    visited my eldest sister (Jennie) missing the marriage of her youngest daughter,
                    caused by a delayed train. </p>
            <p>I stopped in Memphis, Union City, Hickman, (Ky.) Martin, Fulton, (Ky.) Dresden,
                    and McKenzie to Paris. At the invitation of Comrade J. W. Howard, there, I made
                    his home my stopping place and was kindly reated by his sons and daughters and
                    self. </p>
            <p>I had the free use of my father-in-law&apos;s horse and buggy, Comrade S. A.
                    Miller&apos;s horse and Mr. Joe Howard&apos;s buggy, at different times and rode
                    or drove rather over the country, selling my book. I also went by rail to
                    Murray, Paducah and Mayfield, Ky. At the latter place I visited my sister Alice
                    and my wife&apos;s brother, M. M. Cox.</p>
            <p>My book sold pretty readily at $2.00 in 1903, but I found on returning in 1904,
                    that many had borrowed it and its sale was so slow that I reduced the price to
                    $1.00</p>
            <p>The malarial season returning in the fall I was again attacked with a chill and
                    fearing to risk the malaria, and cool weather being due I decided it was best to
                    come home. </p>
            <p>During the winter and early spring, I built up my health and early in May 1906, I
                    returned to Tenn. I stopped to view the battle-fields at Lovejoy and Jonesboro
                    and Kennesaw Mt. Though I had no one to help me enjoy it, still it was a
                    melancholy pleasure to visit again the stirring scenes of the Civil War or the
                    places that recalled them to mind. I stopped in Chattanooga during the session
                    of the Southern Baptist Convention and then continued my trip to Paris, making
                    my headquarters at Comrade, J. W. Howard&apos;s, but also visiting my
                    father-in-law, four miles S. E.</p>
            <p>Dr. S. H. Caldwell kindly loaned me a mare and buggy and I rode over not only
                    Henry County, but also parts of Benton, Henderson, Carroll, Gibson, Weakley and
                    Obion in Tenn. and Calloway, Graves and others in Ky. I had to hunt up the men
                    who had served in the Army or the men and women, whose relaties or friends had
                    been soldiers. It was a tiresome and tedious business and sometimes very
                    discouraging. But there was compensation in the fact that I met many old
                    friends, some of whom I had not seen since my boyhood. </p>
            <p>Early in Sept. I found I had sold nearly all the books I had bound and I called
                    together the endorsers of my note. Mr. A. B. White and comrades, S. H. Caldwell,
                    S. A. Miller and R. P. Diggs</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="0012_000244_000203_0064.jpg" xml:id="d3e1692"/>
            <p>62</p>
            <p>responded and messages were sent by comrades, S. C. Cooper and I. T. Irion. I
                    told them that before any more money could be gotten out of the book, more would
                    have to be put into it, by having more of them bound and asked if I should use
                    some I had in bank for that purpose. They asked me how much of the note was
                    unpaid, and when I told them $93.00, they said that each would pay his prorata
                    part $9.30 each, and that they expected to have more than that to pay. I thanked
                    the heartily and felt that I was the happiest man in Paris.</p>
            <p>I soon wound up my business and returned home, bidding adieu to old friends and
                    scenes of my boyhood and early manhood, perhaps never to see them again. </p>
            <p>I stopped at Winchester to see my son John and family and also my brother-in-law,
                    Col. J. D. Wilson and family, and at the battlefield of Resaca. </p>
            <p>Since returning home in fall of 1906, I have done little in the way of earning a
                    living. While residing at 2219 Hubbard Street I had a large garden and made
                    something at raising vegetables, but not near so much as in Jacksonville. </p>
            <p>In February, March and April 1904 I had been Office Editor of the Florida Baptist
                    Witness, then published at Jacksonville. W. A. Hobson and W. L. E. Mahon
                    Editors. I resigned when I started to Tenn. When the paper was again moved to
                    Jacksonville in March 1909, I helped Bro. C. M.Brittain in the Witness Office,
                    and for a month was acting editor. I enjoyed it immensely, especially editing
                    the Notes and Comments department for which I have both taste and talent. The
                    pay however was only nominal and as the confinement indoors was not good for my
                    health I resigned. </p>
            <p>I was reelected Chaplain of the State Senate in 1905 and 7. My friends amond the
                    held over senators in the Legislature of 1909 alloted the Chaplaincy fo Senator
                    H. H. Buckman of Duval. But he was an anti-probitionist and did not want me, and
                    selected an Espicopalion of Tallahassee. It was very trying, especially when I
                    knew I would receive the votes of two thirds of the Senators, had it come to a
                    vote. My friends were indignant as those amond the holdovers had given him the
                    selection because I was a candidate andone of his constituents, &quot;To be
                    forewarned is to be forearmed&quot; and so when I learned that Bro. D. H. Sloan,
                    Senator from Polk County, had been allotted the right to name the Chaplain, I
                    went to work. At the request of Leon I let him make the overtures and the
                    friendship of Bro. Sloan and the volunteered intercession of Senator Hudson
                    secured my selection and so I am here again in Tallahassee and am enjoying the
                    chance to work thus in the Master&apos;s vineyard. To him be all the praise. I
                    am glad also that I have the opportunity to earn something to secure the
                    necessaries of life. My pension of $120.00 a year, my salary as Chaplain,
                    probably $200.00 for two years being allI have to depend on.</p>
            <p>SEPTEMBER 20th, 1912</p>
            <p>After the Legislature adjourned June 2nd, 1911, spent the summer mainly at home,
                    reading, making scrapbooks and etc. Surveying boundaries of Callahan in July was
                    rather too much for me. Did two or three other small jobs. Had an attack of
                    cholera morbus. August 5th Mrs. R. spent a few days visiting Maggie and family,
                    and Ella some at Plant city with relatives, and I was</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="0012_000244_000203_0065.jpg" xml:id="d3e1714"/>
            <p>63</p>
            <p>much alone. Ed being away some as detective. Had an attack of bowel trouble
                    September 5th. This with previous cholera morbus left me in a bad shape and so
                    September 24th went to Hampton Springs for two weeks, paying $10.00 per week
                    board. This helped to start me on the up grade, and I continued to improve. </p>
            <p>January 15th, 1912 I went to Lady Lake to visit Maggie and family till the 22nd
                    and then to Ocala to the State Baptist Convention. Was re-elected Secretary and
                    got throug my duties very well. </p>
            <p>As the Confederate Reunion met at Macon, Ga. nearer to me than ever before, I
                    decided to go to it, leaving home May 6th. The crowds were so great and I was so
                    nervous that I had to keep pretty quiet. However enjoyed some any way. On the
                    10th I had my ticket extended and went to Tenn. visiting Sister Alice and
                    daughter Ethel, at Chattanooga, then son John and family at Fayetteville, Tenn.
                    The Bro. Tom and wife and son Hansford and family at Summertown, Sister Jennie
                    and her daughter Edna and family at Iron City, and her daughter Nellie and
                    family at Iron City, and meeting her son Winfield on the train, stopped a day or
                    so with Sister Alice at Chattanooga and reached home June 4th having enjoyed the
                    trip very much. </p>
            <p>The summer was very warm, but in some respects enjoyable, especially the almost
                    entire absence of flies and mosquitoes, which seems wonderful. It is likely,
                    mainly the result of the efficient work of the City or County board of health. </p>
            <p>September 3rd, Ella went to Lady Lake to visit Maggie and family. I was taken
                    that day with bilious fever, lasting only parts o two days. But it was followed
                    by inflamation of the bronchial tubes. This Dr. Dean says in an accompaniment to
                    the cases in the city which is epidemic here. By the second day Mrs. R. was
                    attacked and was barely able to prepare light food for both of us and for
                    several days it was a struggle with both of us to keep going. Some of the
                    neighbors helped and when it became known to the church members, they began to
                    call and send in food. the attacks lasted about two weeks. Ella had her attack
                    (though of shorter duration) before she left home. </p>

            <p>The following was added by Mrs. Cora Annie Markert, oldest daughter of E. H.
                    Rennolds. </p>
            <p>Here our father laid down his pen, - never to take it up again. &quot;What I have
                    written I have writen.&quot;</p>
            <p>To quote his own words from the introduction</p>
            <p>&quot;no on knoweth when his life on this earth will be closed.&quot;</p>
            <p>On Sundy morning-November 17th, 1912 his ended. As the first hymns of the morning
                    worship were being sung at the Main Street Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Fla.,
                    word was brought that Borther Rennolds had just died. As the announcement of the
                    sad news was made to the assembled congregation, it was evident how much he was
                    loved and esteemed by those in whose fellowship he had lived. Grief at his
                    departure will be felt all over the state for he ws intimately known from one
                    end of Florida to the other. It could have been said of him that he was a man
                    &quot;in whom there was no guile:&quot; a simple, sincere soul: a gentle,
                    lovable spirit; meek, but firm and unswerving in principle.&quot;</p>
            <p>Written by his Pastor</p>
            <p>Rev. W. L. C. Mahon.</p>
            <p>His body sleeps in the family lot in Evergreen Cemetery, Jacksonville,
                    Florida.</p>
            <p>SINCE FATHER WENT AWAY.</p>
            <p>The raindrops fall more sadly down,</p>
            <p>The drifting leaves are sere and brown,</p>
            <p>Since Father went away. </p>
            <p>The say more closely bends above</p>
            <p>A mound where lies the form we love,</p>
            <p>Since father went away. </p>
            <p>More sacred seems each hoary head,</p>
            <p>More fraught with weight the word we said-</p>
            <p>Since father went away. </p>
            <p>A far more solemn thing is life,</p>
            <p>A far more useless thing is strife,</p>
            <p>Since father went away.</p>
            <p>The word of God is far more clear,</p>
            <p>And heaven itself is ever near,</p>
            <p>Since father went away.</p>
            <p>Cora Rennolds Markert.</p>
