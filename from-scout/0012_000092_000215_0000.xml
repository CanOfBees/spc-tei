               <note type="abstract">1864 January 17 Southgate Cregmile in Chattanooga, Tenn., to his brother Crittenden. Acknowledges receipt of his letter and assures him that he and all the hometown boys are doing well. Even though it is very cold, railroad cars are running well and often; thus, rations are plentiful and his newspaper is arriving. Mentions that many soldiers there are enrolling in veterans services and going on furlough. Smaller Companies have less impact and are not leaving. Tells of one of the Regiment commanders getting married while on furlough. Asks him to write soon.</note>
