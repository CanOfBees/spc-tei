            <p>Sir,</p>
            <p>The clause impolicies of his would, by which it is agreed to referr any dispute to arbitration, has unquestionably a very unequal operation; for while the insurers are bound to adhere to it, the insured is at liberty to close, or not, as the court cannot be ousted of its jurisdiction, any thing in this Contract to the contrary notwithstanding&quot;.</p>
            <p>Nor is this clause more exceptionable in principle, than injurious <unclear reason="illegible" resp="AH">fracations</unclear> in practice.</p>
            <p>The insured, who perfer a claim, which he knows is not forounded on Law, or usage, - with demand in arbitration, because, it costs nothing, &amp; he may gain, but cannot loose.  This tribunal, (seldom composed of men learned in the Law, but often of those who</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_002414_000212_0003.jpg" xml:id="d4e76"/>
            <p>however upright, connot discard a bias infavor of an individual apposed to many ) - determine, in too many instances, a greeably to their own crude notions of what they call the equity of the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="AH">case</unclear>, contrary to Law &amp; the most settled practice and usage of trade..</p>
            <p>It is therefore our wish to expunge this clause from the policy, but as it should be generally done, if done at all, we salut the consideration of your board to the subject-, &amp; that you be good enough to advise us of the result - .</p>
            <p>For &amp; by order of the President &amp; direction of the Maine Insurance Company of Alexandria.</p>
            <p>I am very respectfully</p>
            <p>Love Yr mst Obedt Friend</p>
