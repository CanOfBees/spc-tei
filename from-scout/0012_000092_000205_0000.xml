               <note type="abstract">1863 February 14 Southgate Cregmille in Chattanooga, Tenn., to his brother Crittenden. Assures him that all the recruits from their hometown are well. Mentions the weather and how it always begins to rain when they receive their marching orders. Has no idea where he will be the next time he writes. Concludes the reason for being paid more often is that the rail cars are getting through from Knoxville. Hopes the fact that hundreds of Rebel Gen. Braxton Bragg&apos;s men are deserting means that soon he will be caught.</note>
