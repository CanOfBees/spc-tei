            <p>Joseph Ball Esqr</p>
            <p>Sir,</p>
            <p>Mr John Blaggi informs us that the North America Insurance Company were underwriters upon the Cargo of the Ship Flora Cup.  
				       Joseph Lovett, bound from the Spanish Maine to New York for $20,000 (Say twenty thousand Dollars)  This Ship was Captured
				       and carried into Jamaica where the Cargo was Condemned, notwithstanding every exertion of William Savage &amp;Co. who 
				       had undertaken to claim the same, but it was at the same time thought proper to Lodge an appeal; which has been done, and 
				       the necessary papers for prosecuting the same are now in our possession</p>
            <p>Messr William Savage &amp;Co. have expended in endeavouring to prevent the Condemnation of vessel and Cargo a considerable
				       Sum, which Mr Blaggi</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_002414_000298_0003.jpg" xml:id="d4e72"/>
            <p>in his present situation is not able to pay, and us a considerable part of the money expended has been for the benefit of the Cargo
				        we are of opinion that such Sums as has been expended for that purpose should be paid by the underwriters upon the Cargo, we
				        shall therefore expect before we deliver up the necessary papers to prosecute the appeals that the underwriters in the Cargo will
				        pay their proportion of the Expence.  We believe you yere already have been furnished with the accounts,  if however you have
				        not, we will forward them to you.  Your attention to this business will oblige</p>
            <p>Your humble Servants</p>
            <p>John Murray &amp;son</p>
            <p>paid on the Cargo of the above Vessel}  $17,657.64</p>
