               <note type="abstract">1863 March 28 Southgate Cregmile in Murfreesboro, Tenn., to his Mother (Eleanor Griffin). Assures her that all there are well. Because there are Rebels within two miles of their picket lines, they are moving the camp closer to the commander&apos;s headquarters. Even though music and newspapers are the major ongoing camp distractions, he wishes he had better access to certain Ohio newspapers. Will send her the words to a couple of songs heard often in camp and suggests she let some of those totally opposing the war in general (Copperheads) read them. Urges her to write soon.</note>
