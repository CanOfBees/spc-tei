            <p>December 19, 1868.</p>
            <p>Paymaster General</p>
            <p>About two years ago I made an application for my additional Bounty of one hundred dollars which I am entitled to according to the act of July 28, 1866. On making out my application I used the forms and followed the printed instructions furnished by your department, enclosed my discharge and addressed it to the Paymaster General, Washington, D.C. My P.O. address was then Woodington Darke Co. Ohio.</p>
            <p>I have now waited until the time has almost expired for the payment of such claims but have never yet received an acknowledgement of the receipt of my application. I cannot renew my application because my</p>

            <p>discharge is gone. Many of my comrads have since made their application in the same way and have received their Bounty. Now what I would be glad to know is what has become of my application. I know you have hundreds of thousands of applications to dispose of, but having waited about two years I begin to think that mine has never reached your department. Any information you may be able to furnish me will be thankfully received.</p>
            <p>I have the honor to be</p>
