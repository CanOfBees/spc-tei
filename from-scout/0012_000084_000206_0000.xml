               <note type="abstract">In this letter, dated May 13, 1865, from P. S. Lincoln in Cincinnati, Ohio, to W. J. Stevens in Nashville, Tenn., Lincoln informs him that McCallum&apos;s Bridge Company has gone out of business, but that he can use their machines to make rails for 55 cents each. He explains that the price has been increased as the machine will be run for only this purpose and because the price of lumber has been increased. The letter also includes notes from W. J. Stevens and N.E. Van Sickle about the correct distances between the holes in the rails. </note>

            <p>Dear Sir</p>
            <p>Your <unclear>duplicate</unclear> to Bristol was rec&apos;d and in his absence I replied. We have the sample of Trimble splice block made for Mr Anderson -- 5 ft long 3 X 5 oak, bored for four holes thro&apos; rails and three for spikes to ties. Also a piece of rail <unclear/> of <unclear/> I inclose.</p>
            <p>The McCallum Bridge Co have closed business and sold their shop etc but I can get the use of the machine to make these blocks and wuld like to contract for a quantity of fifty -five cents (55 cts) each, delivered here at the shop. The old price was fifty cents, but they were made at a time when the shop was in full operation, and they were mixed in with other <unclear>such</unclear>. Now however it will be necessary to run the machinery especially for the purpose and the price of lumber has increased. After I get lumber in can deliver about five hundred a day. Let me hear from</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="0012_000084_000206_0002.jpg" xml:id="d3e179"/>
            <p>soon and the number for <unclear/>, if you decide to contract for them.</p>

            <p>The <unclear/>sample of rail is correct also length of splice the centre holes should be 6 in apart (from centre to centre) and the end holes 18 in from the centre holes</p>
