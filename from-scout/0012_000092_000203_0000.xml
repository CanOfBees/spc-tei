               <note type="abstract">1862 December 1 Southgate Cregmile in Nashville, Tenn., to his brother Crittenden Cregmile. Shares with Crittenden that currently all are well in Nashville and hopes the letter finds him well also. Assures him that as the Rebels continue to scout around the town, they need not worry about taking it, since it is surrounded by fencing and a continuous rifle pit behind that. Aware that they are fortifying at Murfreesboro, General Rosencrans wants them to fortify there so they will make a stand when attacked and won&apos;t be running off to Chattanooga because they are unprepared.</note>
