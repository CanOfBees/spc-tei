            <p>Col O.P. Temple</p>
            <p>Dear Sir; Enclosed please find a paper from Greene Co. in reference to a son of Mr Geo. Smith. I waited for you &amp; searched for you yesterday without success &amp; hence send you the petition by hand of a friend. I wished to talk to you in regard the young man &amp; would have liked to visit him. He has been very quiet since his return from Vicksburg &amp; indeed, I believe, never was boisterous as most others of his class. He lives in my immediate neighborhood &amp; I have seen him &amp; talked with him several times &amp; I know him to be a wellbehaved &amp; well disposed man. That he is chargeable with bearing arms, or anything of that sort, I believe is utterly without the show of reason or proof - such a fact is unheard of in my region. True, he &amp; his father are rebels, but they serve a good purpose to their union neighbors sometimes yea many times in protecting them from disorderly rebel soldiers. This of course makes us kindly disposed to them &amp; to want </p>

            <p>them at home. I assure you that by doing something in this behalf, you will gain the respect of union men in my neighborhood. </p>
            <p>Col, I have some few negroes to lose, but the nigger is dead, let us bow to the manifest will of Providence who &quot; causeth the wrath of man to praise him. &quot; Respectuflly Yours SG</p>
            <p>Sam&apos;l S. Doak</p>
            <p>P.S. Mr. Geo. Smith informed me he had written you employing your aid in this case. S. S. D.</p>
