            <p>Memphis Mar. 21st 1861</p>
            <p>Col O P Temple,</p>
            <p>Dear Sir,</p>
            <p>I will give you a thousand dollars for Rebecca and four hundred for each of the boys, which is a good price for the times.</p>
            <p>I will not have any use for her here until fall and besides it would be dangerous to bring her and her children to Memphis until fall. I must confess that I would like very much to own Beccy, indeed have a very strong preference for her, and have often regretted that I ever sold her. You can write me what you are willing to take, for I dont think you or I will endeavour to make any illiberal profit off of each other.</p>
            <p>I hope your friends will let you alone in your profession, for I believe you can accomplish more in solid reputation and otherwise at the law than you can in the dusty and hazardous and laborious arena of politics. Secession is rappidly growing in West Tennessee.</p>
            <p>My kindest regards to Mrs Temple. In closed I send you a note of Thos W. Hurries on Turley. I wish</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="0012_000070_000231_0002.jpg" xml:id="d3e180"/>
            <p>you would look into the condition of the case in the Chancery Court and see if the rule for the former notes is complete and all right, and for the collection of the inclosed note take such steps as you may deem proper. Confer with Thos W. Hurries.</p>
            <p>With sentiments of lasting regard</p>
            <p>I remain yours &amp;c.</p>
            <p>WYC Humes</p>

            <p>W Y C Humes</p>
            <p>A April 10/61</p>
            <p>Wrote that he might have negroes at his offer.</p>
