            <p>In Sepr: 1790 I had Insurance made in your office on Francis &amp;Mary from Canton for Mr Charles Vaughan  &amp;not being in a
				       situation to give my own notes, for the premium of 4500 D. I prevailed upon M Vernbeusen to give his &amp;M Fitzsimmons to endorse
				       them, upon my Brothers assurances that M Lenox would, out of the Sale of a Vessel provide for 3000. D. &amp;that the ballance would
				       be guarantied by M Apthorp, under these assurances, which I urged they might Confide in, they took up the Policies for me __ An Attachmt.
				       in My <unclear reason="illegible" resp="pw">illegible</unclear>or some misunderstanding since with M Lenon, has prevented anything
				       from that quarter coming forward_  An unfortunate Attachment at Boston on The Ship in the Harbor before arrival in Port, has for some 
				       time locked up the funds there, &amp;although the premium is ultimately Secure, yet I have not been able to get one Dollar towards is
				       from my Brother _  I confess Gentlemen I feel myself much distressed, that any accident should have arisen to Cause disappointmt to 
				       you, or throw the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="pw">Burthen</unclear>, upon those friends who Stepd. forward to serve me, when
				       that Burthen would be highly injurious, - Under all circumstances, permit me to offer the following arrangement.  The notes of T. Smith &amp;
				       Buchanan, John Donnel, John Hollins, John Smith Jr. Samuel Smith _ all jointly to Geo. Stiles Payable at         Dolls.     United States Bank for
				       2300 D. due 10 Sepr.  1696.42.  in Decr. 3996:42 Ballance with the Interest in Cash _  The Transaction has been entirely my own, &amp;
				       the Insurance Policies could never have been taken up but on my assurances, which have unfortunately proved fallacious _  The Vessel is 
				       arrived Safe, &amp;your premium will in this way be well Secured.  Your obt. Servt.</p>
