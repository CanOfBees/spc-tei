            <p>I received the inclosed order from Brig; Gen; Hurlbert yesterday (Sunday) evening. Please send me a written permission to continue my services as I did while Gen: Sherman was here, i.e., by leaving out the prayer for the President. I make this request to you, not because I think you, Gen: H. or any other Gen: or state officer has a right to </p>

            <p>direct me in the services of the Church. The Church of Christ we are taught in Holy Scripture is His body. He is the head of it &amp; it is governed by the Bishops which are the successors of the Holy Apostles. The Church in this country, as it should be throughout the Catholic world, is entirely Pope-free &amp; state-free -- the Bishops have the right to appoint our services -- our good Bishop &amp; our Diocesan Convention have given me my directions concerning services, which I have followed. I appeal to you then, knowing that Gen: H. has the right of might or force to make me close my church <unclear>, &amp;</unclear>

            <p>I appeal to you as his superiour officer to give a written permission to continue my services as heretofore. Please send me the permit as soon as you can &amp; you will very much oblige</p>
            <p>Yours Respectfully</p>
