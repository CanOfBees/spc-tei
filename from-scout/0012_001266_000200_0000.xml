               <note type="abstract">The letter was written by Gustavus A. Peltzer (a soldier of the 1st WI Heavy Artillery, Company C), on July 2, 1863, and is addressed to his friend Ellis Birch. The letter, written in response to previous correspondence from Ellis, details the events that led to his imprisonment in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Captain had ordered some men to be mistreated. Some who took part were arrested, but never tried. Peltzer told his friend he had tried to stay out of the whole affair, so he couldn&apos;t figure out why he was arrested. His trial had been 4 weeks prior to his writing this letter. He did not know until trial what he was charged with. The judge dismissed all charges except the one in relation to conduct to the prejudice of good order. He got in trouble for something he had told an enlisted man about the Captain. The Captain held grudges. Some testified to lies. He thought his sentence would be light. The collection also contains the original envelope used for this correspondence.</note>

            <p>Knoxville Jul, 1st 1863</p>
            <p>Friend Ellis</p>
            <p>Yours of June 11th with letter inclosed from Mr J. Silsby was received today. It
must have been detained at the Battery, as it evidently went there for it was
handed to me by one of the boys, C Darling, who is in the hospital here, he
brought a batch of letters for us all. Thinking it interesting to you how I came
to be in the military prison I will give you a new addition of Battery
&quot;C&quot;s history. On the 14th of May the Capt ordered three men to
<unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">wit</unclear> Mooney Alsop &amp; Ed
Rogers to be bucked &amp; gagged the were left that way for Eleven hours when
Boyers completely gave out,</p>

            <p>&amp; to save him from a horrible death the Sargt of the guard - <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Morey</unclear> had to cut him loose. This
exited the men &amp; some 30 or 40 went to the place where the other two were
yet confined, with a determination to release them - The first asked <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Morey</unclear> to release them he refused but
made no resistance they were then cut loose &amp; taken to their quarters
&quot;with a yell.&quot; By this time the Capt. got wind of it <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">and</unclear> he appeared with side arms
making, to tell the truth, a very rediculous individual of him self, soon
Everything was quiet &amp; the excitement subsided. The <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">next</unclear> morning, <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Act Corpl. Meark Lewis Parv Chauncey
</unclear> Baker, Ed Mood &amp; Hans Kittles on were arrested as the Leaders in
the affair, <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">wherever</unclear> they took
no more of an active part than the rest. The following day</p>

            <p>
               <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Kegge</unclear> Lloyd Rittman &amp; myself
were arrested and at noon we were sent to Knoxville &amp; turned over to the
military Prison - It was at first a mistery to me, what I was arrested for, as I
had taken great <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">foams</unclear> to keep
out of the whole affair, I was well aware that the Capt would ask for nothing
better then to get such a &quot;hold&quot; on me, you know what for - It is now
nearly four weeks since I had my trial &amp; it was then for the first time that
I learned what I was charged with. It was this - for telling Ed <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Hewilt</unclear> in March last at Chatta. that
the Captain had used Jim Lloyd mean &amp; that I was going to prefer those
charges again The charge was &quot;conduct to the prejudice of good order &amp;c
telling the above to Enlisted man; He had two more charges against me - for
preferring</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="0012_001266_000200_0005.jpg" xml:id="d3e241"/>
            <p>charges against him &quot;outside of the proper channell,&quot; but they were
<unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">stricken</unclear> out by the Judge
Advocate So I was tried on the first. Hegge was also tried for telling P.B.
Nelson In the eventful night &quot;that the boys did not go to work right they
should have blown out the light and than pitched into the Captain&quot; he told
Nelson so in confidence and that mean specimen of humanity reported <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">it</unclear> Wood was tried. When the court
was <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">broke</unclear> up and here the other
three are without a trial &amp; probably never will get one. Wood had <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Killabee to</unclear> swear against him &amp;
he testified to a pack of lies of course - We are expecting our sentence every
day, think mine will be light if anything. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Led</unclear> whom the Captain had an old gruge against, is
charged with falsly accusing the Captain of knowing him to be <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">excused</unclear> by the Dr. a mere triffle
His object was to send us with them in some way. I had a long talk with the
<unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Ring</unclear> before my trial came
up, he tried to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">withdraw every</unclear>
charges altogether but it was two late - Lloyd dodged <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">them</unclear> by going to the hospital Lev
&amp; <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">Hegge avalse</unclear> at the
Hospital - I shall not send this untill tomorrow may I will get my sentence to
day but if I do not I will let you know but let this not keep you from answering
this, all send their respects</p>
            <p>Yours <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JCM">GA</unclear> Peltzer</p>
