                    <l>And naught in the waters below it,</l>

                    <l>Keep it, dear friends, and show it--</l>
                    <l>Show it to those who will lend an ear</l>
                    <l>To the tale that this trifle can tell,</l>
                    <l>Of a liberty born of the patriot's dream,</l>
                    <l>Of a storm-cradled nation that fell.</l>
                    <l>Too poor to possess the precious ores,</l>
                    <l>And too much of stranger to borrow,</l>
                    <l>We issued to-day our promise to pay,</l>
                    <l>And hoped to redeem on the morrow.</l>
                    <l>The days rolled by and the weeks became years,</l>
                    <l>But our coffers were empty still;</l>
                    <l>Coin was so rare that the treasury 'd quake</l>
                    <l>If a dollar should drop in the till.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg>
                    <l>But the faith that was in us was strong indeed,</l>
                    <l>And our poverty well we discerned,</l>
                    <l>And this little check represented the pay</l>
                    <l>That our suffering veterans earned.</l>
                    <l>We knew it had hardly a value in gold,</l>
                    <l>Yet as gold each soldier received it;</l>
                    <l>It gazed in our eyes with a promise to pay,</l>
                    <l>And each southern patriot believed it.</l>
                    <l>But our boys thought little of peace or of pay,</l>
                    <l>Or of bills that were over-due;</l>
                    <l>We knew if it bought us our bread to-day,</l>
                    <l>'Twas the best our poor country could do.</l>
                    <l>Keep it: it tells all our history over,</l>
                    <l>From the birth of the dream to its last;</l>
                    <l>Modest, and born of the angel, Hope,</l>
                    <l>Like our hope success, IT PASSED.</l>

                    <p>The late "Rebellion" or the war between the the North and
                        the South will furnish themes for discussion, and battle
                        scenes to be gone over again by all who were engaged in
                        it, and after they have passed into the beyond, to
                        history will go down the ages to be read by coming
                        generations. The war cloud that spread over this country
                            <date when="1861">1861</date>, grew from a dark spot
                        not bigger than a man's hand, seen first in <date
                            when="1620">1620</date>, and out of which issued the
                        edict calling forth the 19th Tennessee regiment, and
                        enrolling her name upon the War God's historic scroll.
                        When the "Mayflower" landed her cargo of Puritan
                        Pilgrims on Plymouth Rock, they found Negro Slavery,
                        evidently the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds"

                    <p>There it germinated and matured, until in the spring of

                        resulted in Civil War. This Negro question not yet
                        observed by the masses, was evidently the dark
                        background of the coming struggle. Of all the storm
                        clouds that have passed over the country, none ever
                        blackened the political firmament as did this. The
                        darkness was so black and ominous as to attract the
                        anxious gaze of the civilized world, and nations looked

                            when not drilling the men were on the move all the

                            quiet reigned. The different maneuvers in drill and
                            in the manual of arms occupied our attention during
                            the day. There were guards at regular intervals
                            around the encampment. These were called sentinels
                            and had so far to walk back and forth, called beats.
                            During the hours of the night, when the dull tramp
                            of the soldiers was hushed in sleep, no sound was
                            heard save that of the sentinel on his beat, and the
                            calling of the poast and hours by the sentinels.</p>
                        <p>Col. Cummings had an old negro man named "Munger."
                            Old Munger was a fife and could play only one tune,
                            which he called "My wife is sick" Poor old Munger I
                            can hear him now. Munger staid with the regiment

                            are at head quarters for rotten eggs." The next day
                            by prearrangements of the Ladies they gave us a
                            "Barbacue" at the station. Men, women, and children
                            were there from all around. Our two companies
                            marched and counter marched, while our band did its
                            best marching at the head of the column. We were the
                            "Elephant" that day. On the morning of the 24th we
                            moved on towards the Gap encountering rough roads,
                            and crossing Clinch and Powell rivers, we pitched

                        <p>We had not been long in the Gap, when one of Co. "A"
                            was taken sick and died, and was buried with
                            military honors. His death was the first recorded in
                            the regiment. Men and women and children came into
                            camp daily, bringing butter, chicken, eggs, &amp;c
                            to sell.</p>
                        <p>Soon we had the Confederate flag floating in the
                            breze from the "Pinnacle" one of the highest points
                            on the mountain. Up in Virginia some 10 miles were a
                            few Cavalrymen, who did picket duty along this part
                            of the mountain. One day in July these cavalry men
                            brought into camp some twenty men as prisoners, whom
                            they had captured, who were making their way across
                            the mountain into Kentucky. Among them was Thos A.K.
                            Nelson of Jonesboro Tenn. Col. Walker sent them on
                            to <name type="place">Knoxville</name>. Frequently
                            men would come into camp and remain until late at
                            night and go home. Here we had sentinels all around
                            our encampment at close intervals as the ground was
                            so rough. One post was withing ten steps of my tent,
                            which was twenty feet above the road leading up the
                            mountain. The sentinel was posted in this road. One
                            evening a Virginian came into camp riding a fine
                            horse, hitched him and intended remaining late. The
                            night was dark and the overhanging treas where the
                            sentinel stood rendered the darkness more intense.
                            About nine Oclock the Sentry heard steps approaching
                            in the road on the inside of the camp, as if someone
                            was trying to slip by him, or upon him. What ever it
                            was, it would make one or two steps cautiously and
                            halt, then two or three more and halt again. Being
                            so dark the sentinel could not see anything. Closer
                            and closer came the steps, when we heard the
                            sentinel challenge the approaching foot steps.</p>

                            the sentinel, yet the steps came closer. Click click
                            we heard the sentinel's gun as he made ready to
                            fire. Halt once more he cried and bang went his gun.
                            A horse wheeled and ran back some twenty steps and
                            fell dead. It was the fine horse the Virginian rode
                            in the evening before. It had gotten loose and was
                            trying to get by the sentinel. Col Walker, one
                            evening was carelessly handling or shaking a box of
                            caps in his hand when they exploded, blowing open
                            the box and pieces of caps cut his hand in several
                            places.</p>
                        <p>July the 4th Col Cummings came up to the Gap with the
                            four companies he had with him, and the third day
                            after Maj Fulkerson came up with the two he had. All
                            the regiment was here now and drill was the order of
                            the day. We had to go down into the valley on the
                            Tennessee side to find ground on which to drill. We
                            fortified the Gap by throwing up works across the
                            Gap. Throwing up the breast works and drill gave us
                            something to do.</p>

                        <p>The Rev David Sullins was our Chaplain with whom we
                            were all in love. He preached regularly for us and
                            each sunday evening we had Sunday school, our
                            Chaplain the superintendent. Now and then false
                            alarms would be given, and such a hustling on the
                            mountain side to get into line. When these alarms
                            were made at night, the men, in their hurry to get
                            into position, would fall down and some times roll
                            several feet down the steep side <note>
                                <add place="above">of the mountain</add>
                            </note> before getting a foot hold. In the Gap, our
                            camp was up in the Clouds. And frequently we would
                            be in the center of a storm clound and the lightning
                            would seem to leap out of the clouds and fall in
                            round balls to the ground. One clear bright morning
                            about 9 oclock the sun seemed to shine with unusual
                            brightness</p>
                        <p>A dense fog<lb/>came drifting down the mountain
                            hunting a place to cross. It was so heavy it would
                            not rise above the Mountain top, and sought an
                            opening in the Gap. On reaching the Gap it began
                            pouring itself through and so dense was it for an
                            hour the sun could not be seen, and part of the time
                            we could not see objects ten feet from us.</p>
                        <p>Our short stay in the Gap will long be
                            remembered.</p>
                        <p>About the last of August Col Brammer's battalion of
                            Cavalry came up to the Gap, and they were closely
                            followed by the 15thMiss Col. W.S. Stathon; the 11th

                            out a detachment under Col Battle composed of two
                            companies from each regiment, and one battalion of

                            was camped. Companies "B" and "K" were detailed from
                            the 19th Tennessee regiment. Early in the morning of
                            the 13th they ran upon the enemy in a corn field
                            just past this side of town. Company "K" of the 19th
                            Tennessee was thrown out as a skirmish line and it
                            advanced on the enemy and began firing. While it was
                            but a small skirmish line, and this being their
                            first under fire, it seemed like fighting and
                            sounded of battle. In this little battle Lieut
                            Robert Powell of Co "K" was killed, and a few others
                            were wounded. This made the 19th Tenn loose the

                        <p>It had been raining for several days, and the morning
                            of September the 25th we started out in one of the
                            hardest rains that had fallen for some time. We
                            encountered rought mountainous roads and swollen
                            streams. Some places on our journey we could not see
                                a<del rend="strikethrough">n</del> hundred yards
                            except by looking up. We passed but few habitations
                            and they were stuck upon the mointain's side. The
                            rain continued pouring in torrents all the day
                            rendering our progress difficult yet on we went. The
                            morning of the 3dday we arrived at Goose Creek about
                            two miles above the Salt Works, the objective point
                            of our journey. We found the creek much swollen from
                            the resent rains. The road and this creek ran down
                            between the ridges together. They took it time about
                            in crossing each other and alway went through each
                            other. In the two miles we had to go down this creek
                            we had to wade it seventeen times. At each crossing
                                <del rend="strikethrough">we had to wade</del>,
                            we lost some mud <del rend="strikethrough">each

                            There was plenty of honey here and the boys first
                            loaded up on honey, filling them selves with it
                            until it became too sweet to be good. So sick many
                            of them were that they cared for neither honey nor
                            salt. For some time after, just to speak of honey
                            and the boys would gag.</p>

                            and almost fagged out. Having fulfilled our mission

                            down in camp and rested. Mr. White who had charge of
                            the salt works, had a fine lot of ducks and geese.
                            The boys had killed several of them, and Mr White
                            was complaining to on of the regiment John Webster <note>

                            </note> about it. Webster told him it was a shame
                            and he would see that the men were punished and that
                            no more would be killed. Just then a duck he had
                            concealed under his coat began to quack and at once
                            he had business with the regiment and the old man

                        <p>We had now been out nearly four months playing the
                            roll of soldier. The exhilarating life in the
                            beginning had now somewhat worn away, and camp life
                            had become a monotonous routine of military duties.
                            We had done but little as yet, but from indications
                            we would soon enter the arena of war in truth. And
                            after the wire edge of our martial chivalry shall
                            have been worn away, we may and will be more able to
                            stand in the storm of battle. While we lay idle in
                            Camp Zollicoffer the Federals concentrated a

                            Cat. The rout through the mountains was rough and
                            heavily timbered, the greater part of the way was
                            between precipitus ridges which rendered our march
                            hazardous. To retard our advance the enemy had
                            fallen trees across the road, and in other ways had
                            obstructed our way. We did not reach the enemy until

                                <name type="person">Gov. A.S. Marks</name> whe
                            was with us, and who commanded a company in the 17th
                            regiment says, "The hill on which the enemy had
                            fortified was at the head of a gorge about a quarter
                            of a mile wide. This fortified hill commanded the
                            road ovar Rock Castle hills. The day before the
                            enemy was reached, we found the road approaching the
                            hills and miles away from it obstructed by fallen
                            trees. Men were put to work to clear away the
                            obstruction. We were not allowed to eat or sleep
                            until the enemy was reached next morning. We moved a
                            hundred yards at a time as the fallen trees were
                            gotten out of the way. When the hill was reached the
                            road was found impassable from the fallen trees. The
                            advance was through the woods. We found the face of
                            the hill a precipitous bluff with but a small place
                            accessible. My company only could <note>

                            </note> ground to ascend which we did, and found the
                            entrenchments of the enemy but sixty yards from the
                            crest, with abuis in front. We opened fire which was
                            briskly returned. My company filled all the
                            available space, so we could not be reinforced and
                            we were recalled. I lost in my company six killed
                            and twenty wounded. Some were killed and wounded in
                            the other companies. No other attempt was made to
                            assault any where else." Col Newman's regiment was
                            the only one engaged, and his loss in all was eleven
                            killed and twenty Seven wounded. The loss of the
                            enemy was but five killed and eleven wounded.
                            Zollicoffer returned to camp at Cumberland Ford,
                            where after a few days rest, he began an evacuation

                        <p>October the 30th we bid adieu to camp Zollicoffer
                                <del rend="strikethrough">(and left it to the
                                inexorable Fates)</del> Moving out early in the
                            morning, we headed for the Gap, through which we
                            passed and turned down the mountain towards <name
                                type="place">Jacksborough Tennessee</name>.</p>
                        <p>Two regiments Col Rain's (11th Tenn.) and Col
                            Newmans' (17 Tenn) were left at the Gap to hold it
                            against occupation by the enemy. We reached
                            Jacksborough November the 4th where we remained a
                            few days blockading the passes along the mountain.
                            At this place unfavorable indications began to show
                            regarding the future usefulness of our young brass
                            band. Col. Cummings ordered all the men belonging to
                            the band, except the old Field band, to carry their
                            guns, this the men did not feel like doing, carry
                            their guns and horn. So on the morning of our
                            leaving Jacksborough we stacked our horns on the
                            ground and left them. This was the demise of our
                            "Brass Band." The regiment fell back on the old
                            Field band which she never abandoned, nor did the
                            little faithful band ever prove truant to its trust
                            and on the morning of the regiment's last roll call,
                            this same faithful Field band called them into line.
                            X Leaving Jacksborough we passed through Wartburg
                            and Montgomery and after crossing "Little Emery"
                            river, we assended the Cumberland Mountains again on
                            whoses top we traveled for thirty miles through as
                            lonely and desolate a country as could be found. We
                            passed a residence about every six miles, till we
                            reached Jamestown the County Seat of Fentress, a
                            small cluster of houses in a rocky, barren country
                            almost destitute of any sign of life, where the
                            wind's only song is a sad requiem of starvation.
                            Leaving the mountain just beyond Jamestown we turned
                            our course northward, and the second day we entered

                            the river above. We were in a bend of the river, and
                            our line of works extended from the river above
                            nearly to the river below. We had not any kind of
                            drill since we left Cumberland Gap. And as for
                            brigade drill such a thing had not been mentioned.
                            Here we were too busy building breast works and

                            sixteen regiments of infantry, cavalry and
                            artillery. Our cavalry were now at the front all the
                            time, and every now and then would have a spat with
                            the enemy. On the eighth of January our cavalry
                            brought into camp fifteen or sixteen pris<note>

                            </note>ners among whom were Maj Helverts and Capt
                            Prine, both of the engineer corps. It was reported
                            that a regiment of infantry was encamped on the
                            creek not far from the river, nor very far from our
                            encampment. So, the morning of the tenth the 19th
                            Tenn was sent out to see after them. We left camp
                            about three oclock in the morning. It was very dark
                            and a cold drizzling rain falling and very muddy. As
                            we drew near the supposed camp of the enemy our
                            movements were at a snails gait, so slow we could
                            not keep up sufficient circulation to keep warm, and
                            freeze we thought we would. We moved on so
                            cautiously, we were not allowed to step <note>

                            </note> as to make a noise. Our feet were so numbed
                            with cold we could not stand on one foot, and to
                            move was painful. They felt as if a thousand needles
                            were sticking them.</p>

                            seemed full of needles pricking them. This cold wade

                            comfortable. We returned to Camp with only the

                            arrived. Col Mose White with his regiments remained
                            at Mill Springs and did not cross the river. Gen
                            Thomas at this time had joined Gen Schoeff at
                            Somerset, with his eight thousand infantry, cavalry
                            and artillery. The combined force of the enemy now
                            was (12) twelve regiments of infantry, two regiments
                            of cavalry and four batteries. He began an advance

                        <p>Friday night of the 17th Gen Crittenden called a
                            council of war, composed of the brigade and
                            regimental commanders and captains of batteries, to
                            consider the best thing to do: whether to attack
                            Thomas before he could cross all his forces over the
                            now swollen creed, or wait for him to attack us in
                            our entrenchments. The result ot the council was to
                            move on the enemy at the earliest possible
                            moment.</p>
                        <p>It was said in camp the next morning Gen Zollicoffer
                            and Col Cummings oposed the advance and the
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>All day Saturday the men were busy inspecting their
                            arms and getting everything ready for the attack.
                            Fishing Creek although a small stream was now
                            swollen out of bank. It ran nearly <del

                            emptying into the Cumberland river about six miles
                            above <name type="place">Mill Springs</name>. The
                            crossing was on the road leading from <name
                                type="place">Somerset</name> to Mill Springs,
                            and about twelve miles from our encampment. On this
                            or the western side of the Creek is a low bottom
                            land for some distance. For two or three hundred
                            yard out from the Creek was heavily timbered and
                            from this to the top of the ridge was cleared and
                            under cultivation and was about three hundred yards
                            wide, the public road dividing it into two large
                            fields. On the west side and near the foot of the
                            ridge stood a log cabin which we used as a field
                            hospital.</p>
                        <p>Saturday night at midnight the army was put in
                            motion. The night was dark and cold, and the bitter
                            winds drove the sleet and rain in our faces, yet on
                            we went, plodding in the gloom and mud to the front
                            and to battle.</p>

                        <p>Sunday morning the 19th at daylight the Cavalry ran
                            upon the enemy's pickets One and a half miles out in
                            their front. A few shots were exchanged and the
                            enemy slowly fell back to his main line. Our Cavalry
                            did not push them. The 15th Miss took the front
                            closely followed by the 19thTenn. Soon we
                            encountered their main picket line at the foot of
                            the ridge, which as we approached fell back to the
                            top of the hill. We halted at the foot of the ridge
                            and formed line of battle. The balls begain passing
                            over our heads pretty fast with a zip, zip. They did
                            not seem to be shooting directly at us, for they
                            were not more than two hundred yards away but on the
                            hill above us.</p>

                        <p>The 15th Miss formed on the right of the road with
                            the 20th Tenn Col Battle joining them also on the
                            right. Then two regiments formed the right wing of
                            our line of battle. The 19th Tenn fell right into
                            line facnig the front just on the left of the road,
                            joining Battle's regiment, while the 25th Tenn
                            formed to our left and just a little in our
                            rear.</p>
                        <p>Gen Carroll had not yet come up and had not fourmed
                            line of battle. For our regiment to get into
                            position we had to file through an old persimmon
                            thicket, and as we entered it Col. Cummings said to
                            me, we will hang our overcoat, blanket and haversack
                            on this (a large persimmon) bush we were just
                            passing, and we will gather them on our return. We
                            did so, but neither of us ever saw them again.
                            Getting into line, we moved up the hill to the left
                            of the road, the enemy retiring over and beyond the
                            top of the ridge. By the time we reached the summit
                            the firing was getting brisk.</p>
                        <p>The 15th Miss first opened the battle, engaging the

                            </choice> then Battle opened on the enemy. The 19th
                            Tenn encountered the 10th Indiana about half way
                            between the top of the ridge and the woods in the
                            bottom. The 19th Tenn charged at a double quick
                            closely followed by the 25th Tenn, and drove the
                            enemy under the shelter of the wood.</p>
                        <p>The 15th Miss and 20th Tenn by this time had also
                            driven the enemy from the top of the ridge into the
                            woods below, thus forcing the whole Federal line
                            from the clearing in to the woods on the creek.</p>

                        <p>The rains continued falling, some times in heavy
                            showers. Many of the men had the old Flint lock guns
                            which were in this rain, utterly useless. The writer
                            saw two or three boys break their guns over the
                            fence, after several attempts to fire them.</p>
                        <p>Rutledge's battery was planted on the hill just to
                            the right of the road, and opened with two or three
                            shots only, our own men being in danger of his
                            shots, he fired no more. While in this position Capt
                            Rutledge had his horse killed under him by a cannon
                            shot from the enemy. Gen Carroll formed his brigade
                            in line just under cover of the ridge and awaited
                            orders. The morning was dark, the smoke from the
                            guns was beaten back by the rain, and settling on
                            the ground increased the gloom. By this time the
                            19th Tenn was in the edge of the woods and many of
                            our boys had on home made blue jeans cloths. We had
                            driven the 10th Indiana back into the woods, and the

                            mistook the 4th <choice>

                            passed our regiment to cease firing, and all this

                            the regiment fell back a short distance in some
                            disorder. The enemy pressed forward capturing the
                            body of Gen Zollicoffer and also that of Lieut Baily
                            Peyton who was killed at the same time. Lieut Peyton
                            was one of Zollicoffers staff. The 25th Tenn came to
                            our relief and we checked for the time any further
                            advance of the enemy.</p>

                            woods back some distance when Col Stanton of the
                            25th fell severely wounded. The 28th Tenn came to
                            our help, we charged the enemy driving them back but
                            a short distance, where we took shelter behind an
                            old fence and kept up a heavy fire for some time.
                            The roar of musketry and cannon seemed to us a
                            considerable battle. The enemy again reinforced
                            their right and began a flank movement and forced
                            our entire left wing back on the top of the ridge.

                        <p>As we went into the battle, and after having driven
                            the Federals from the open fields, we picked up a

                            and falling fast. When nearly to the woods we spread
                            our coat on the ground and one of our wounded, who
                            with our help could get no further, lay down upon it
                            to die. The wounded were taken from the field as
                            fast as could be done, some left at the field
                            hospital, others were taken on to camp and from
                            there to Montecello. The last one we helped on this
                            sad morning, was Charley Clemonson of Co "E" 19th
                            Tenn, who fell mortally wounded, about half way up
                            the ridge after we had been driven from the woods.
                            Pink Henderson, Clube Perry and myself were carrying
                            Charley on a blanket. We had just reached the yard
                            of the log cabin on the hill side where was our
                            hospital. All were in the house that could be gather
                            in, and we had to lay Charley down on the ground.
                            Our men were now hurrying by as rapidly as they
                            could, the road and woods were full all in hot haste
                            to be gone. Woods' <choice>

                        <p>As the Federals began descending the hill and before
                            reaching the field hospital, we having done all we
                            could, retired in as good order and as quickly as we
                            could. Poor Charley was dying when we laid him down.
                            We can never forget the sad, anxious expression of
                            his face as we left him in the last sad trial of the
                            battle of life, dying alone desertd by all whome he
                            thought were friends, left on the cold ground with

                            Webb died in hospital at Monticello from wounds.
                            Lieut G.W. Hull, John Jordan and W.H. Barger died in
                            camp before the battle came off.</p>
                        <p>As a regiment, this was our first engagement with the
                            enemy, and while they were no better off in point of
                            experience than we, they were decidedly so as to
                            arms and numbers. They were no doubt better drilled
                            then we were. It has been said of Gen Zollicoffer
                            that his life, his mental make up and trend of
                            thought were opposed to that of the Military. <choice>

                            </choice>, says of Gen Zollicoffer, "he could not
                            drill a squad himself, nor was his brigade ever
                            drilled or put into a line of battle by any one,
                            until the morning of the memorable battle of
                            Fhishing Creek." To these causes only can be
                            attributed our defeat. For we know <note>

                            equal. But a few days before the battle of Fishing
                            Creek the Steamer "Noble Ellis" came up from
                            Nashville with provisions and clothing for the men
                            and had not yet returned. Her presense was<lb/>Our

                        <p>During the evening all the men were in the ditches
                            and remained until dark, when a detail was left to
                            be on the look out and the rest of the men returned
                            to their cabins to prepare meals, for we had not
                            eaten any thing since the evening before. We had
                            plenty to cook. My mess had supper ready, hot
                            coffee, hot biscuit meat &amp; all spread upon a
                            rudely constructed table, in our comfortable

                            the dark to go whither we knew not.</p>

                        <p>After we had left camp and had gotten to the river
                            the realization of our misfortune came crashing upon
                            the heart like an avalanche, we were retreating.
                            While on the river bank, waiting in the cold and
                            dark, we could not but think of our straw beds and
                            new blankets wood cut and piled up in the cabin
                            &amp; the warm fire we left burning we are on the
                            river bank in our compact mass of excited and
                            confused humanity. Thousands were crowded there
                            waiting, each his turn to get on the Noble Ellis as
                            she crossed and recrossed.</p>
                        <p>The enemy just a little over a mile behind who from
                            their battery above us on the hill, kept constantly
                            shelling the boat as she crossed back and forth with
                            her excited fugitive loads. The Cavalrymen were
                            hooping and hallowing to drive their horses into the
                            river to swim them over. A few and very few of the
                            horses ever crossed, many of them were perhaps
                            drowned, but the greater part of them remained and
                            were captured.</p>
                        <p>Here were Artillerymen without their artillery,
                            Teamsters without their teams and Cavalrymen afott.
                            What a racket and confusion reigned here and right
                            in the face of the enemy.</p>

                        <p>A hundred of the enemy could have captured Gen
                            Crittenden's whole Army. If one gun had been fired
                            just behind us hundreds doubtless would have been
                            pushed into the river. The enemy must have thought
                            we were reinforcing. At last we were all over,
                            landing the last boat load at day break. From the
                            Mill Springs side of the river we could see our
                            encampment plainly. And not before sun up did the
                            enemy begin an approach to our works, nor until
                            after they saw the smoke and flames rising from the
                            burning boat.</p>
                        <p>As the Noble Ellis went up in smoke we could but feel
                            sad, for she had remained and rescued us but lost

                    <p>January 20th we took our last farewell look at Beech
                        Grove and Mill Springs. We turned our faces sadly and
                        sorrowfully southward and beheld in the distance a long
                        journey hitherto unparalleled, through a rough, barren,
                        and unfriendly country. We needed sympathy but received
                        none; save that from the heavens, which looking down
                        upon our forlorn condition poured out upon us in heavy
                        showers her sympathetic tears but the did not make us
                        feel any more comfortable.</p>
                    <p>Through all day long the rain continued to fall, when
                        late in the evening we passed through Montecello wet,
                        mudy and tired, not only in body but in mind. We
                        presented an appearance to excite pity rather than
                        applause. One mile beyond the town we sad down to rest
                        for the night. We did not pitch our tents for we had
                        none, neither had we blankets to spread upon the cold
                        wet ground upon which we lay and with naught but the
                        leaky clouds for a covering. Having had nothing to eat
                        all day long, we lay down with empty stomachs to dream
                        of the plenty we had left in camp. The commisary did
                        drive up &amp; The next morning we had issued to us an
                        ear of corn to each man (as if we were horses) to parch
                        for breakfast. After building our fires which were very
                        poor for want of wood, and what we had was wet and
                        sobby, we porched our corn in the ashes and ate it and
                        started on our march<lb/>Through the Wilderness.</p>

                        <p>The long gloomy road this morning stretched its self
                            out to nearly one hundred miles before we could see
                            any visible signs of provisions or comforts of camp
                            life.</p>
                        <p>So all day Tuesday we plodded our weary way, we
                            passed every now and then country homes where <note>
                                <add place="above">there</add>
                            </note> seemed to be plenty but we were none the
                            better off. Night came again to rest our weary limbs
                            and sore feet, but nothing came to satisfy our now
                            keen appetites but a small piece of beef yet warm
                            from the slaughter, no salt, nothing else. As for my
                            self, we did not feel the gnawings of hunger as much
                            as we did in the morning. We roasted our meat by the
                            fire and ate it, and lay down on the rocks and
                            slept. The next morning we ate the remnants left
                            from supper and started on our third days march at
                            the end of which we received beef, salt and
                            meal.</p>
                        <p>We knew how to manage the beef, but how about the
                            meal. We had nothing to put it in, nothing in which
                            to bake it. The meal was issued to <note>

                            baked before the fire on flat rocks, boards, or
                            anything we could find <note>

                            </note> We ate and enjoyed our supper, retired for
                            the night feeling beter and thankful. Who knows what
                            they can endure when they are put to the test.</p>
                        <p>The next morning we moved out again feeling weary and
                            worn, for this pouring through the wilderness as we
                            called it, was a rough and tiresome one.</p>

                        <p>We reached <name type="place">Gainsboro</name> on the
                            Cumberland river Jan 27th where we were met by a
                            Steamer from <name type="place">Nashville</name>
                            with clothing, provisions <note>

                            </note> tents.</p>
                        <p>We remained here about ten days resting. We needed
                            rest for our weary bodies and rest for our minds.
                            After crossing the river at Mill Springs many of the
                            men whose homes were in East Tennessee left us and
                            went directly to them, but returned to their
                            respective regiments after a few days stay at home.
                            This made our army small when we reached Gainsboro.
                            From this place we moved down the river to opposite
                                <name type="place">Carthage</name> where we
                            camped for a while. Here we had inspection and
                            drill. We who remained with the army felt anxious to
                            hear from home folks, and to let them know we were
                            yet in the land of the living. The same feeling now
                            was filling each breast that filled the heart of the
                            Poet who wrote <lg>

                            </lg> Our dishartend and drooping spirits were now
                            beginning to revive. The runaways, as we called them
                            were beginning to return. And we sing <lg>

                            </lg> We picked up courage and our tents and leaving

                        <p>As we drew near to Lebanon we could see plainly the
                            differense in the responsive sympathy of the people.
                            We began to receive encouragements and greetings by
                            the way side. For they were in full knowledge of our
                            retreat from Fishing Creek. Grand-mothers, Mothers
                            and sisters came out and greeted us, giving us their
                            blessing to cheer us on our way. No doubt they had
                            sons, husbands, and brothers some where in the
                            Confederate Army. Perhaps some were with us. We
                            passed through Lebanon February the 16th and there
                            we learned of the fall of <name type="place">Fort

                            against us. To us our political firmament began to
                            look dark and dreary. We took hold of this

                        <p>The sad news of the disaster at Fishing Creek, the
                            fall of Fort Donnelson, and the evacuation of <name
                                type="place">Bowling Green</name> spread like
                            wild fire over all the South. A great many of the
                            Newspapers were full of epithets and denunciations

                            time, and the Newspaper men thought perhaps if they
                            had been at the front things would have gone
                            differently. They forgot that enduring the hard
                            ships of camp life, and fighting the battles at the
                            front were much more difficult, than sitting around
                            the comfortable fire side and fighting them on

                            had the utmost confidence in him as their leader.
                            Often those who censure most are the ones who do
                            nothing to bring about that for which they condemn
                            others for not doing.</p>

                        <p>The battle field formed a parallelagram of about
                            eaqual sides. The river and our line of battle
                            formed two opposite sides and Owl Creek below and
                            Lick Creek above the other two opposite sides. The
                            two creeks entered the river about three miles
                            apart, and our line was formed about three miles out
                            from the river. The ground within this boundry was
                            very uneven, being interspersed with ridges,
                            ravines, and marshy places, with afew clearings in
                            the heavy wood lands. There were several small
                            streams, some running into the creeks and some
                            directly into the river.</p>

                            to face all Saturday night; the enemy like a wild
                            boar in his den not aroused by any alarm of unseen

                            grand review.</p>
                        <p>The enemy were completely surprised. Only a few
                            having finished breakfast, some were yet in bed and
                            asleep, and none ready or expecting such an attack.
                            The enemy, whose encampment our brigade so suddenly
                            and so rudely entered, so early and with out notice,
                            were some what indignant and were thrown into great
                            confusion. But they rallied and made an attempt to
                            give us a soldierly reception. Our men kept pressing
                            forward with a determination not only to gain
                            ground, but to hold all that was gained. The enemy
                            under a continuous fire of musketry and artillery
                            fell back on their second line, which had been
                            formed and for awhile checked our advance.</p>
                        <p>Hardee on the left drove the enemy back on his second
                            line held by McClenard, which enabled Hardee now to
                            strike <name type="person">Sherman</name> on the
                            flank forcing him to retire with considerable loss
                            of men and several guns. Gen Johnson led Jackson's
                            Stewarts Bowen's and Statham's brigades in a
                            successful charge on our right. They advanced "En
                            echelon" with the batteries in full play. The
                            resistance was vigorous and the contest was fierce.
                            Dead and wounded marked the ground over which they
                            struggled.</p>

                        <p>The enemy was now driven back all along his line his

                            disadvantage of ground, and seemingly a superior
                            force. The fighting was desperate all along the
                            line. The roar of musketry and artillery, the
                            bursting of shells the cracking of grape and
                            canister against the timber and the zip and whiz of

                        <p>Between twelve oclock and one in the day the enemy

                            on our right where they had collected a heavy mass
                            of troops. Up to this time there had been four hours
                            of hard fighting, almost an incessant blaze of fire
                            all along the line. We had driven the enemy back on
                            our right to this eminence, where they had massed
                            their troops. It was held by Hulbert who had been
                            reinforced by three brigades, and there they stood
                            in double columns defying every attempt of ours to
                            dislodge them.</p>

                            </choice> had ordered Statham's (our) brigade and
                            Bower's joined by Chalmer's of Wither's division, to
                            charge and drive the enemy from this ridge. Statham
                            was on a ridge opposite to that of the enemy and
                            about two hundred yards from them. To charge the
                            enemy at this point, our brigade had to cross this
                            exposed ridge, descend the slope and ascend the one
                            the enemy occupied commanded and raked by their
                            deadly fire. Here we stood delivering and receiving
                            a fire which Gov Harris said was as heavy as any he
                            had ever heard and as heavy as any in the war. We
                            could not drive them by our fire and to charge them
                            seemed like going into the very jaws of death. This
                            position was called the <lb/>"Hornet's Nest,"</p>

                            the army, and continued the battle.</p>
                        <p>Up to this hour two oclock in the evening there had
                            been scarcely an intermission or a lull in the
                            battle; but now, an occasional pause was observed in
                            the roar of battle. The right and the left of the
                            enemy's lines had been driven back, while the center
                            seemed to hold its own.</p>
                        <p>Here Gen Ruggles had concentrated twelve battries in
                            front of Prentis who was stubornly holding the
                            center of the enemy's lines. Hardee had driven back
                            the enemy before him, killing Gen W.H. Wallace which
                            uncovered Gen Prentis' right, while Polk and
                            Breckenridge closing in on his left, cut Prentis
                            off, forcing him to surrender with about three
                            thousand men. This was late in the evening about
                            four or five oclock. <note>

                        <p>Some of Breckenridge's men now exchanged their guns
                            for Enfield rifles captured from Gen Prentis. A few
                            of the Old 19th Tennessee exchanged guns.
                            Immediately after this Statham and Bowen pressed
                            forward and gained possession of the crest of a hill
                            over looking the river, and not far above the
                            landing, where they endured for a while most
                            terrific fire from the enemy's gun boats. McClenard
                            being now exposed on account of Hurlbut's retreating
                            column was assailed by Gen Hardee.</p>

                            enemy in his last line, overlooking and crowding the
                            river.</p>

                            covered with dead and dying, sadly echoed with the
                            groans of the suffering. <note>

                            of pandimonium. When the battle ended for the day,

                            but brave boys must contend in the morning. Of

                            behind which I knew the enemy were in great force,
                            and enter it in fine style. Then arose the severest
                            musketry fire I ever heard for at least twenty
                            minuts when the splendid regiment of Williche's had
                            to fall back." The old 19th Tenn was at the
                            reception of this charge of the enemy.</p>

                            was near Shiloh Church where the worn out
                            Confederates had successfully contended against the
                            enemy. We were gaining no ground, nor were we
                            loosing ground.</p>
                        <p>Gen Beauregard about two oclock in the evening
                            ordered a halt, when seemingly by mutual consent the
                            battle eneded. Just at this moment as the firing
                            subsided all along the line, the enemy were
                            reinforced by three fresh <orig>brigads</orig> from
                            Wood's division but they did not renew the attack.
                            Beauregard at this time ordered our (Statham's)

                            enemy, and to act as a rear guard to the now
                            retreating Army. These two brigades camped Monday
                            night on the battle field near where the fight began
                            Sunday morning. Tuesday morning as we moved back

                        <p>Reader it is useless to attempt a

                            Shiloh. Language would fail to portray it as it was.
                            The dead were piled on each other in many places. In
                            the center of the battle field was a pond, in and
                            around which were many dead men and several dead
                            horses, were either killed there or had been wounded
                            and had gone there for water and had died, which
                            could truly be called the "Death Pond" of Shiloh.
                            All over the field the dead lay side by side, the
                            brave "who wore the blue and those who wore the
                            Gray" now no longer foes.</p>
                        <p>The wounded of both armies, who yet remained on the
                            field, showed the true manhood and brotherly feeling
                            by helping each other as far as possible, consoling
                            each other, and sharing each others woes.</p>
                        <p>The Blue and the Gray had fallen on each other and
                            lay as if sleeping in each others embrace.</p>

                            contests. Our brigade was the second in the list of
                            casualties. The brigade lost one hundred and thirty
                            seven killed, six hundred and twenty seven wounded,
                            and supposed captured forty five.</p>

                            pathetic scenes, during the strife of battle.</p>
                        <p>During the first day's fighting John Easterling of
                            Company "C," poor fellow, was wearing a blue shade
                            of home made clothing. A piece of shell tore away
                            the greater part of his lower jaw, he could not
                            speak and wanting help, he went up to Lieut B.F.
                            Moore of Company "I" the Lieut did not recognize
                            him, and thinking he was a wounded Federal spoke
                            sharply to him, ordering him to the rear, where help
                            could be had, where he died very soon.</p>

                        <p>Twelve long eventful months had now gone by since the
                            Confederate States began battling for a position in
                            the galaxy of nations. And these months had not
                            passed with out results.</p>
                        <p>They had sealed the destinies of thousands of her
                            noble sons. They had brought blight to once happy
                            homes and loving hearts. And grim master Death had
                            been busy hanging crops on the door knobs of those
                            who had gone out in defense of their Southern homes;
                            thus reminding the loved ones there, that the vacant
                            chair around the fire side, would never be filled by
                            them again.</p>

                            one year, and now that year had ended, and the war
                            but begun. Now comes the true test of patriotism. At
                            the beginning we did not know all that was
                                <orig>ment</orig> by the word war, but now we
                            knew it in all its horrors. Our time was out and we
                            could have honorably gone home. But no. When we
                            thought of home and what brought us out, we could
                            not return as yet.</p>

                        <p>All the old officers who were not reelected left us
                            for other commands, preferring to be privates under
                            other men than those, over whom they had had
                            command. After we had settled around Corinth, we
                            began fortifying</p>
                        <p>The Federals had followed us at a long distance
                            slowly, and had sat down at a safe distance to watch
                                <name type="person">Beauregard</name>.</p>
                        <p>We remained here nearly two months during which time
                            the pickets kept up almost daily a musket at
                            artillery duel.</p>
                        <p>The water we had to use was of the poorest kind, very
                            bad and only accessible by digging holes in the
                            ground one or two feet deep, and allowing them to
                            fill up with seep water. After exposure to the sun
                            but a day or two, the water would be full of wiggle
                            tails. The use of this water soon begain to tell
                            upon the health of the Army. The sick list ran up at
                            a fearful rate, and the mortality increased daily.
                            Beauregard sent the sick away as fast as they could
                            be moved.</p>

                            Vandorn arrived with seventeen thousand men. He

                            evening and met Buel's new men, if he had, we would

                            his munitions, and as soon as this was accomplished,
                            the Army began falling back towards <name

                            morning of the 25th Our regiment, the old 19thTenn,
                            was sent down the Mobile &amp; Ohio RR several miles
                            to protect a bridge we thought was threatened by the
                            enemy. The bridge was a cross a creek running
                            through a low swampy country, and in a perfect
                            jungle. In this place we lay for about one week,
                            with scarcely enough of ground above water to lie
                            down and sleep on. The under <orig>groth</orig> was
                            so thick that just now and then, here and there, the
                            Sun could get through the foliage to give life to
                            the struggling vegetation, dying for the want of sun
                            light. About noon, the 2d day of June, we crawled
                            out from our hiding place in the swamps, and out of
                            the mud and water, on to dry ground, to sun and dry
                            ourselves. We moved out from this place without a

                            from any thing we had yet met with. Our encampment
                            was out from the city about two miles. Our water
                            supply for the first few days was from an old pond,
                            full of green moss, and in order to get the water
                            free from moss and filth, we had to dip our vessels
                            carefully into the water and seperate the moss, we
                            were on duty picketing along on the levee about five

                            under fire of the enemy's gun boats.</p>

                            two hundred pounders, were bursting over our heads
                            and all around us continually. The air was kept full
                            of flying missiles falling here and there, and often
                            wounding women and children in their homes and on
                            the streets. Shells would go crashing through a
                            residence. The streets were kept torn up by the
                            shells falling in them and going into the ground
                            bursting would tear up the ground. The shells from
                            the mortar boats would come down almost
                            perpendicularly and imbed themselves in the sandy
                            soil from three to five feet before exploding. It
                            was fun for the boys when one of the shells would go
                            into the ground, the boys would gather around the
                            hole and wait for the explosion of the shell, which
                            would throw dirt all over them. The lower fleet was
                            about three and a half or four miles below the city,
                            and the upper one about three miles above directly
                            opposite the city across the peninsula.</p>
                        <p>The hills around the city and below had many
                            beautiful residences on them. There was one large
                            home on one of these hills not far frmo the lower
                            fleet, from the top of which the fleet could be seen
                            plainly.</p>

                        <p>The boys would gather upon the top of this house to
                            watch the maneuvering of the fleets. One day the
                            boys of the old 19th were on top for a look out, and
                            had attracted the attention of the enemy, and they
                            made the house a target. The boys got down and off
                            the top none too soon for the second shot demolished
                            the house.</p>
                        <p>Their boats were very restless, moving about staying
                            in one position but a short time each fleet had a
                            small boat we called the "Fice" and they were
                            continually on the run, to first one boat and then
                            an other. While we were here, the Federals began
                            cutting a canal across the peninsula. They worked
                            principally at night, for during the day our guns
                            made it too warm for them to stay in the canal.</p>

                        <p>For several days, the enemy had two mortar boats tied
                            up to the bank on our side of the river. The old
                            19th and a part of the 15th Mississippi regiments
                            under Col Walker, were sent down to investigate the
                            right they had taken in so doing, and to take them
                            in if necessary.</p>
                        <p>The day was an exceedingly hot one, and but little
                            air was stirring. The road was graded cutting
                            through the small hills like a railroad and when we
                            would get into one of these cuts, the heat was so
                            oppressive that it was almost intol<del

                        <p>The distance we had to go was about four miles Many
                            of the men were over come by the heat and fell by
                            the way side completely exhausted. There were more
                            Mississippians fell out on account of the heat than
                            Tennesseeans. The writer gathered leaves and put
                            them in his hat, changing them every few minits, he
                            came very near giving it up at one time. The sun
                            light seemed to go out, everything became dark, he
                            staggered and would have fallen, but sitting down
                            for a little while this wore off and he moved on
                            alright. Finally we reached the river bottoms,
                            across which we must go, through marshy places, mud
                            and lagoons.</p>
                        <p>There were bamboo briars in <orig>abondance</orig>,
                            whose long thorny arms reaching out for every thing
                            that passed by them, were ahead of us and awaiting
                            us. We fail to express it when we say that it was
                            with great difficulty we picked our way across the
                            bottoms and reached the levee beyond, upon whose
                            crest for some distance above us and below us, was a
                            thick heavy cane, which completely hid us from view
                            of the enemy. On reaching the cane brake, we found
                            the object of our search lay about one hundred yards
                            below us. Moving cautiously down the levee behind
                            the cane, until we thought we were far enough, and
                            even with the boats we made a rush forward to the
                            river.</p>

                        <p>The lower end, or left wing of our column fell in
                            about twenty yards above the nearest boat. Out in
                            the river before us lay the entire fleet like a
                            small village on the water. The two boats were
                            moored close to the bank sleeping, some playing
                            cards, and others on the deck. Little did they dream
                            of danger.</p>
                        <p>One or two vollies from our guns sent several of them
                            to their long homes. Just how many were killed we
                            could not tell. It was only a moments work and we
                            had to take shelter behind the elevation of the
                            Levee just in time to save our selves, where we had
                            to remain for a while. Oh! My! It seemed as is the

                            their defense and came crashing through the cane
                            after us. From the sides of every boat came shot and
                            shell, grape and canister until the boats seemed
                            ablaze of fire, and a sound of one continuous roar
                            of cannon.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the firing subsided sufficiently for us to
                            venture from our hiding, we moved out, while the
                            enemy kept up the firing which hurried us on. We did
                            not go out in as good order as we went <note>

                            comfort, and the writer made for a large Cypress

                            help him, and they too came near sticking. It was

                            our "Gun Boat hunt." On one of these Walnut hills,
                            an Englishman had a fine residence in a beautiful,
                            large, grassy yard full of shrubbery and flowers. In
                            this yard our regiment passed one or two evenings
                            and nights each week, resting on the grass under the
                            shade of the trees. Here we were in plain view of
                            the upper fleet. Our continued presence attracted
                            the attention of the enemy, and when we would be
                            there, the enemy would shell us, the shells passing
                            through the yard and burst near by. This raised the
                            ire of the old Englishman, and he soured on us.</p>

                        <p>After a few shells had gone through his yards and had
                            demolished some of his shrubbery, thinking to
                            fortify against the enemy's shells- he raised the
                            English Flag on top of his house and also on his
                            barns, so we rested under the shadow of the English
                            flag as well as the Confederate flag; while in sight
                            in the distance the stars and stripes floated in the
                            breeze. The Old Englishman soon learned that his
                            flag did not put eyes to the shells of the Federal
                            guns. For one day he was in his barn currying his
                            cow, which was almost a daily business with him,
                            when a shell came crashing through the barn,
                                <orig>bearly</orig> missing him and his cow, and
                            went on its frightful mission to scare some one
                            else. As usual we had to keep up drill and
                            inspection. We had in our regiment a Dutchman and
                            judging from his physical make up, he was of lauger
                            beer fame, from the size of his bay window. One
                            morning Lieut Col Moor was inspecting the regiment,
                            and was getting the men in line. This dutchman's
                            name was "Godhelp." Some how it seemed hard for him
                            to get on a pro<del rend="strikethrough">p</del>per
                            line, his belly would stick out too far. The Col
                            called out "You Dutchman, Goodhelp, put in your
                            belly."</p>

                                calling for vollenteers to go on board the
                                "Arkansas Ram" to attack the fleet just below

                        <p>The question naturally arose in our minds what can
                            one boat do with this fleet which had one &amp; half
                            a dozen. This all was made in all the regiments of

                        <p>The old 19th responded, which she always does, to any
                            duty in any emergency. A detail was sent from our

                            boat. A few days after the detail had been sent from
                            the brigade there was read in the regiment the
                            following notice, which seemed to show there was or

                            examination, that the Lieut and men who vollenteered
                            from my brigade and went on board of the Arkansas

                            will be given that they remain until other wise

                            fever. The six vollenteer firemen called for
                            yesterday were sent to the Arkansas late yesterday

                        <p>Col W.S. Statham our brigade commander had been
                            complaining for several days, although he had been
                            out nearly every day.</p>
                        <p>This communication just given, was the last one he
                            ever wrote or dictated. He grew worse rapidly, and
                            August the 1st he surrendered to grim monster
                            death.</p>
                        <p>All the men loved Col Statham, and hated to give up
                            their brigade commander, and while they deeply
                            mourned his departure, they consoled them selves
                            that his was but a transfer of his enrollment from
                            the Army on earth to the one in the beautiful
                            beyond.</p>
                        <p>While here, we were kept busy day and night on the
                            lookout, for first on thing and <note>

                            there was an other foe we had to contend with more
                            annoying than the enemy's shells. The mosquito or as
                            the boys called them "Gullinippers." Roll up in your
                            blanket ever so well, they would bite you. They
                            either got on the blanket with you and rolled up
                            with you, or they bit you through all the folds. The
                            boys said "Gul or no Gul they had the nippers" and
                            right well did they ply them. There was the barking
                            lizzard, and other curious things. When we first
                            moved out to the hills over looking the river, there
                            was a cluster of bushes neare by, In these bushes
                            were these lizzards and they would every now and
                            then and begin to yelp, just little puppies.</p>
                        <p>After night the enemy's shells were more entertaining
                            than any other time. The fire of the shells could be
                            seen from the time they left the mortar until they
                            burst. Often six or eight would go up at one time
                            following each other. If the night was cloudy, the
                            shells woudl go up through the clouds and be lost to
                            sight for a time. When the bursting time came, they
                            loast all their beauty for the flying pieces of
                            shells made it uncomfortable and dangerous.</p>

                        <p>The "Arkansas Ram," a gun boat, of which notice has
                            already been made, was then in the Yazoo river about
                            twenty miles above <name type="place"
                                >Vicksburg</name>. Her sides, top and bottom
                            were of R.R. iron. She floated deep in the water,
                            was well equipped with large guns.</p>
                        <p>She made her appearance in the Mississippi July the
                            16th To get into <name type="place">Vicksburg</name>
                            she had to pass the upper fleet. Soon as the black
                            smoke began to ascend from the low smoke stack of
                            the Ram, and was seen nearing the Mississippi river,
                            a small swift steamer, belonging to the enemy, that
                            had been for some time lying in wait, watching the
                            movements of the Ram, turned her course homeward as
                            fast as the current of the river and her engine
                            could propel her to give warning that the "Ram" was
                            coming. Out of the mouth of the Yazoo, into the
                            "Father of the Waters" she came and midway of the
                            stream, she floated quietly, yet defiantly for the
                            wharf at <name type="place">Vicksburg</name>.</p>

                            and gave the Ram loud and continued salutes. The Ram
                            was as courteous and returned the fire with vim.</p>
                        <p>She moved slowly, nor turned out of her way, and when
                            her broad side presented to their boats, she gave
                            them shot after shot, the enemy did not relish. on
                            she came triumphantly into port, having suffered

                    <p>Our stay in <name type="place">Vicksburg</name> was for
                        us romantic and full of thrilling events, though some of
                        them were of too shaky a nature to be pleasant. Toward
                        the close of our stay here nearly all the men contracted
                        chills, which constituted the shaking part of our
                        experience. The weath<note>

                        </note> was very hot and sultry. Dr. Montgomery of
                        Mississippi assisted our surgeon Dr. Dulaney, and had
                        charge of the Chill department.</p>
                    <p>Our boys began to be home sick and longed to leave the
                        land of flowers, magnolias and chills, but no furloughs,
                        no transfers were granted. But this did not set back a
                        few of the boys who wanted to get away. Lode Walker,
                        Rufus Staples and his brother Henry, wrote out their own
                        transfers, left us and joined other commands. Their
                        papers were so ingeniously gotten up the signatures of
                        the Officials so exact, that no one ever detected they
                        were bogus. These were from Co "H" of 19th Tenn. <note>

                        <p>Early in the morning of the 5th Gen Clark advanced on
                            the Greenwell Spring road. As soon as it was light
                            enough to see. Gen Ruggles opened the fight by an
                            attack on the enemy's pickets and soon his whole
                            line was engaged. He soon drove the enemy from all
                            his positions.</p>
                        <p>He started in with a cheer and a shout, and the
                            little Army moved forward with the impetuous courage
                            of a mighty force, capturing two pieces of
                            Artillery. Just at this time Col Allen fell loosing
                            both legs from a cannon shot; and following this
                            very soon Col Thompson fell wounded.</p>

                        <p>On our right Gen Clark pressed the enemy back at
                            every point, but was resisted with great
                            stubbornness. After several hours hard fighting he
                            drove the enemy back to his encampment in a large
                            grave just in the rear of the State Penetentiary.
                            Here the battle was most obstinate and fierce, and
                            where the first division suffered the greatest loss.
                            Here Col Hunt commanding the 2d brigade was shot
                            down, and Gen Clark commanding division was badly
                            wounded.</p>
                        <p>The 3d Brigade on our left having exhausted its
                            ammunition was ordered to fix bayonets, and support
                            the 4th brigade in a charge with bayonets.</p>
                        <p>Our whole line had suffered from the gun boats until
                            we had driven the enemy in so close, the boats could
                            do us no harm. It was now 10 oclock AM. and the
                            Arkansas Ram which should have been on hand and
                            putting in her best work, had not yet opened her
                            mouth. At half past ten, when our men had driven the
                            enemy from their last encampment in the grove, and
                            where the fight was such a bloody one, they broke
                            and ran down the streets followed by our men firing
                            on them at every step until they took shelter in
                            Arsenal and Barracks. It was now <note>

                            with drew under a galling fire from the gun boats.
                            We expected to find water in the cisterns, but kept
                            on to a greater distance out. Finding no water here
                            we returned to the front and into the City, where we
                            obtained a scanty supply from the cisterns. All this
                            time the boats were shelling us, but here on this
                            line we remained until nearly night. Having no picks
                            and shovels, and not being able to procure any in
                            the city, we gave up the field with its dead to be
                                <orig>burried</orig> by the Federals. The Ram
                            never showed up.</p>

                            all were proud of the record.</p>
                        <p>We were, and had been for several days encamping
                            around <name type="place">Jackson</name>
                            Mississippi. And since we started out, had gone
                            through some rough scenes. Many of our experiences
                            had been pleasant. We would have enjoyed our stay in
                                <name type="place">Vicksburg</name> much more
                            had it not been for the chills.</p>
                        <p>As it was, our soldiering there was romantic and
                            exciting. We have not lacked for rain. It seemed
                            that rain was one of the necessary concomitants of
                            camp life. While here Gen Breckenridge made some
                            changes in our brigade, which the following order

                        <p>We left our camp the morning of the 10th some what
                            disappointed and took the cars for Holly Springs
                            instead of for home. We started out in one of the
                            hardest rains that had fallen on us in Mississippi.
                            We boarded an old Cattle train all the cars were
                            open but covered, slatted and filthy beyond
                                <orig>discription</orig>. The manure in some of
                            the cars was an inch deep, sloppy and slimy.</p>
                        <p>We were on this train one whole day and one night. We
                            had but little protection from the rain which poured
                            down on us all the way. How we longed for the
                            enjoyment and pleasure of walking. The only place
                            the boys could lie down was out on top of the cars
                            where they had the full benefit of the rain. We
                            finally reached Holly Spring. <orig>Whe</orig> we
                            got off the cars, wet, muddy, and nasty.</p>
                        <p>We were not to be envied either in feelings or looks.
                            We were all sleepy and tired out, and if we had been
                            attacked by the enemy however small the force, we
                            could neither have fought nor run. We moved up the
                            railroad towards Grand Junction a mile or so, where
                            we encamped on a small stream, which reminded us
                            very much of Camp Zollicoffer, where just one year
                            ago we were. How little then, did we think what was
                            before us, what long tiresome marches without
                            anything to eat, and the sleepless night watches
                            that were in store for us. The work of the
                            inexorable "Fates" like the cor<del

                            unseen, yet they wove for us a journey rough and

                        <p>Our boys were now happy. Some danced, some sang
                            "Homeward Bound," and all felt jolly.</p>
                        <p>We again boarded the cars, but before the train moved
                            out, in our car, our jollification was cut short. We
                            were all eating, singing and dancing in turn, when
                            one of our number fell over dead. We supposed he was
                            choked and picked him up quickly, worked with him
                            for awhile but to no purpose. He was dead!</p>
                        <p>Poor Andrew Flenor had received his furlough home to
                            return no more. He was gently lifted from the car
                            and with sorrowing hearts, we left him in Meridian
                            Miss. It seemed more sad than had he been killed. At
                            the very acme of his joys of soon seeing his home
                            and being with loved ones again he obeyed a higher
                            mandate.</p>
                        <p>This was the first death of the kind in our regiment
                            and it seemed to weigh upon the hearts of the boys
                            more than had he fallen in battle.</p>
                        <p>Yet, we moved out from Meredian, as happy as could
                            be, for Mobile.</p>
                        <p>We did not make any halt in Mobile longer than to get
                            aboard a steamer all our effects.</p>

                        <p>On our way across the bay, a soldier fell over board

                        <p>Reader, did time ever fly more rapidly with you at
                            one time more than an other? If so, then you can
                            appreciate, when we say we had scarcely finished
                            shaking hands of welcome until the good by, "God
                            bless you" were <orig>rining</orig> in our ears. How
                            quickly did these Six days go by. They were gone.
                            And as the Camp may be called the home of the
                            soldier, it can be said again the boys are gathering

                        <p>No doubt many reluctantly gave up the comforts around

                        <p>Reader, I tell you this was a soul
                                <orig>stiring</orig> piece. The stillness of the
                            night, each soldier, of both Armies perhaps was
                            holding communion with his own soul, his mind
                            occupied with the thought of what tomorrow would
                            bring, wounds or death, &amp; would he see home
                            again, when the notes of this inspiring song came
                            floating on the stillness of the night. Immediately
                            a Condederate band caught up the strain, then one
                            after another until all the bands of each army were
                            playing "Home sweet home." And after our bands had
                            ceased playing we could hear the sweet refrain as it
                            died away on the cool frosty air on the Federal
                            side. What a thrill of memories must have gone
                            through the soul of all that night. Who knows what a
                            stimulus this Home sweet home gave each one the next
                            day in battle. And as the minie balls sounded the
                                <orig>earley</orig> reveille next morning, they
                            thought it was for home and country.</p>

                        <p>During the night of the 30th Gen Crittenden crossed a
                            part of Wood's division to the north bank of the
                            river, under the impression no doubt that Bragg had
                            withdrawn his men from that side. But after
                            crossing, he found too many Confederates to rest
                            comfortably, so he withdrew under cover of night and
                            bivouaced with the other part of his division</p>
                        <p>
                            <orig>Earley</orig> wednesday morning about 7.30
                            oclock, Hardee with McCown's division closely

                            thick cedars they fell upon Johnson and Davis of
                            McCook's Corps <orig>lik</orig> an
                                <orig>avalanch</orig> before they were aware of
                            his coming, while the invincible Cheatham moved
                            forward upon McCook's center, and drove him from his
                            stronghold and first position. The Federals had a
                            battery concealed behind a cluster of cedars on a
                            dirt road running between the piks which raked our
                            line, but failed to check our advance.</p>
                        <p>Our regiment had advanced to a temporary breast work
                            of loose stones made by the enemy during the night
                            before, and halted for a few <orig>minuts</orig>,
                            when a shell from this concealed battery struck the
                            rock wall, bursting killed one and wounded six
                            others of "I" of the Old 19th Tenn.</p>
                        <p>From this position, our whole line again moved
                            forward to the enemy's Second line, where the two
                            Armies came hand to hand in a musketry fire that was
                            destructive to friend and foe alike. The enemy
                            strengthened their line here by reinforcements, but
                            they could not withstand the impetuous rush of
                            Hardee and Cheatham.</p>

                        <p>Their lines were broken and their artillery horses
                            killed so they could not remove their guns, and
                            three pieces of Artillery fell into the hands of our
                            regiment. These pieces were supposed to have been
                            the concealed battery from which came the fatal shot
                            to Company "I" at the rock wall. In this charge the
                            color bearer was shot down, and as the colors were
                            falling corporal Mason, of the color guard siezed
                            them and bore them aloft as a beacon for the

                        <p>The Federal Gen Post made a desperate attempt to turn
                            our advance, and for a while held us in check, but
                            his men falling all around him, his gunners dead,
                            his horses killed, his guns were silenced and he was
                            forced back to a line of fences where was
                            established one of their field hospitals which was
                            soon in our possession. Gaining this point Hardee's
                            and part of Polk's lines faced due north, having
                            swung around on a pivot resting near midway of the
                            Wilkinson and Nashville pikes forming a right angle
                            with their first line. After driving Rosencran's
                            right around, Polk's whole command moved on Thomas.
                            Here Cheatham's division again bravely faced a
                            shower of shot and shrapnel that thinned his ranks
                            fearfully, but he drove <name type="person"

                            than before, and he fell back. Here in this charge
                            the old 19th lost some of her best men. Here fell

                            and we held our position. Her Col. Loomis, of one of
                            the regiment of Wither's division who came to our
                            help was so badly hurt by the falling of a limb cut
                            from a tree by a shell that he had to be carried
                            from the field. Shot and shell were flying thick and
                            fast, the Artillery fire was very heavy. The Federal
                            Gen Sill, in a wild, and excited attempt to force
                            Cheatham back by an heroic charge, fell near our
                            regiment, he was killed. The battle waxed hotter,

                        <p>Night coming on put an end to the first days battle.
                            In the fight to day the the old 19th Tenn suffered
                            more than any other regiment in the brigade, her
                            loss being a little more than double that of any
                            other. In one of the engagements the regiment halted
                            in the edge of a cedar bottom.</p>
                        <p>Orderly sergeant Joe Thompson of Co "I" ran forward
                            far out into the clearing and captured a
                                <orig>prisner</orig> and as he was returning
                            with him, his <orig>prisner</orig> was killed by a
                            piece of shell while Thompson had hold of him.
                            Letting him fall, Thompson ran forward and captured
                            an other bringing him out safely.</p>
                        <p>During the entire day's struggle, the banner of the
                            Old 19th could be seen fluttering in the breeze in
                            the fiercest of the battle and the thickest of the
                            strife. To day many of the noble old regiment gave
                            their lives as a sacrifice to the cause they loved,
                            and for which they fought so bravely.</p>
                        <p>During the day Bragg drove the enemy from nearly
                            every position he had held, capturing about thirty
                            one pieces of Artillery and 4,000
                                <orig>prisners</orig>, including two Brig
                            Generals, and also 200 wagons and teams. For three
                            miles or nearly, now in our rear amidst the thick
                            cedars and bowlders to where the enemy's lines were
                            formed in the morning their dead, their dying, their
                            hospitals and the wreck of their Army, clearly
                            showed the victorious advance of our men, who
                            bivouaced the first night within a quarter of a mile
                            of the rail road, behind whose embankment the enemy
                            took shelter. As the old year was dying, passing
                            away to be numbered with the things of the past, he
                            saw in vision, a hard fought battle, a bloody
                            contest, which awakened Murfreesboro<del

                            and cedars, as she had never been before.</p>

                        <p>The roar of musketry and cannons filled the valley
                            and shook the very rocks on which the city
                            stood.</p>
                        <p>The night that followed was lonely and dark, The
                            thick cedars and bowlders rendered the darkness more
                            gloomy and dreary. There were no flickering camp
                            fires to be seen although the night was damp and
                            chilly. There was but little moving of troops, and
                            what <note>

                            mouthed cannons seemed to be asleep. Silence reigned
                            supreme. We lay all night with a feeling of
                            loneliness as if all were dead but ourselves.
                            Knowing that all through the cedars and rocks were
                            lying thousands of friends and foes alike
                            unconscious in that sleep from which the morning
                            reveille will not awake them.</p>

                            only from wounds but from cold. Oh! the deep anxious
                            reverie of the soul in such an hour as this! None
                            but those who have gone through it can tell.</p>
                        <p>The gray dawn of an other day, and of an other "New
                            Year" as well, was welcomed indeed, as it came
                            creeping slowly on us, like the vanguard of a mighty
                            army on its foe.</p>

                        <p>It was a relief. It came not to arouse us from
                            slumber, for we suppose but few closed their eyes in
                            sleep that night. But it lifted the deep dread that
                            had settled like a pall over the soul.</p>
                        <p>The morning found our lines pretty much the same they
                            were the evening before. Rosencrans had improved
                            his. Had dropped back from "Round forrest" a point
                            on his line between the railroad and the river, he
                            had occupied the evening before, to a hill further
                            back and also down the river.</p>
                        <p>The next day the enemy maneuvered his troops
                            considerably. He crossed the river with one or two
                            divisions of Crittenden's Corps and a battery of 12
                            guns to the north side, and in front of
                            Breckenridge. Hardee still held the left. Hardee the
                            day before had some of Breckenridge's men and he
                            sent them round to him early in the morning.</p>
                        <p>While Polk in the center, gazed at the iron crested
                            hill in front of him, where fifty mounted "War Dogs"
                            stood ready to be turned loose upon him at the first
                            move he made.</p>
                        <p>As old "Sol" continued driving his fiery chariot up
                            the eastern horizon, the two armies still remained
                            silent, looking at each other like two Mastiffs
                            after a hard tussle, debating whether to open again
                            the battle or not. The afternoon passed with but
                            little more than skirmishing, between the
                                <orig>pickits</orig>, and the darkness of an
                            other night settled every thing into a quiet
                            sleep.</p>

                        <p>The next morning, the third day all was activity and
                            life. There was moving of Troops and Artillery.</p>
                        <p>About the middle of the evening, Breckenridge charged
                            Beatty in front of him, driving them from their
                            position and across the river. Here the fifty guns
                            massed on the hill, opened upon him a perfect
                            tornado of iron hail that <orig>litterally</orig>
                            cut down his men like grass. In this charge Gen
                            Hanson was killed, and Gen Adams wounded.</p>
                        <p>The fight was short, but Breckenridge loosing so many
                            of his men from the battery across the river, had to
                            fall back. This ended the battle of Murfreesboro.
                            Hardee and Polk since the morning of the second day,
                            had gained no new position. During the 2d and 3d
                            days Bragg was busy in getting the spoils from the
                            field, and in <orig>careing</orig> for the dead and
                            wounded.</p>
                        <p>Bragg abandoned Murfreesboro Saturday night sending
                            off the infantry, but the Cavalry remained and
                            occupied <del rend="strikethrough">and
                                occupied</del> the town until monday morning of

                        <p>Our loss in the engagement was very heavy in killed
                            and wounded. We were not as successful in getting
                            the names of the killed and wounded of our regiment
                            as we wished. There were always difficulties in the
                            way, Having too much to do, and could not get the
                            reports. 38 Killed &amp; 111 Wounded</p>

                        <p>Gen Polk went out on the Shelbyville pike and Hardee

                        <p>For a short time our encampment was below and across

                            moved near to Eaglesville where we had encamped once

                        <p>One Nathaniel Pruitt of Company "H" was
                            courtmarshalled for desertion and sentenced to be
                            shot. This was the first and the last death sentence
                            ever passed upon one of the old 19th. Pruitt was a
                            conscript and not a volunteer soldier. June the 10th
                            was the day set for the <orig>exicution</orig>, but
                            through the influence of Col Walker and Maj CW
                            Heiskill, Pruitt was reprieved.</p>
                        <p>He was brought out from prison near the command in an
                            old field. He rode on his coffin. His coffin was
                            placed in front of the open grave and he knelt
                            behind it. The guards <note>

                        <p>So far the months had dragged wearily on with but
                            little excitement. Some of our regiment died in camp
                            while here. One died of Spinal Meningitis. Martin
                            Conwell of Co "B" and O.M. Humphries of Co "B" J.J.
                            Payne of Co "G" and Felix Landerback Co "K" died
                            while we were here on the pike. J.J. Ford Co "G"
                            wounded, Lieut R.G. Rhea of Co "F" was killed on
                            picket, and Liet A. Wm Simth of Co "C" was
                            captured.</p>
                        <p>About the 15th June, the Federal began to make the
                            front all along the line more lively. They began to
                            press our front, and we strengthened our pickets.
                            Videttes became more bold and skirmishing heavier.
                            The old iron mouthed cannon that has been quiet so
                            long was again heard.</p>
                        <p>The evening of 15th our regiment was ordered to the
                            front. We moved out as far as Mr. Lytle's house on
                            the pike, in whose yard we found the enemy's
                            videtts. Our regiment deployed and moved forward and
                            drove the enemy back, and our videttes, or rather
                            our main skirmish line occupied the yard.</p>
                        <p>The enemy reinforced their line and drove our pickets
                            back some two hundred yards and they again occupied
                            the yard.</p>
                        <p>It was in these charges of pickets that Lieut Robert
                            Rhea of Co "F" was killed. We reoccupied the enemy's
                            advanced line again late in the evening. That night
                            the enemy left our front and we saw no more of
                            them.</p>

                            <p>Let the movement be commenced at the earliest

                        <p>So very early the next morning June 27th we pulled up
                            and left our encampment on the pike, was in
                            Shelbyville by 8 Oclock.</p>

                            gotten away, which could be of no benefit to any one
                            save the enemy, we moved towards <name type="place"

                        <p>Our march was slow and difficult owing to the
                            condition of the roads from heavy rains. We came
                            into Shelbyville in the hardest kind of a rain.
                            Commissary and ordinance trains were continually
                            miring up, and with great difficulty were gotten
                            along. We could not leave them. The enemy was
                            pushing for <name type="place">Tullahoma</name>.</p>

                            </choice> halted his men and Cheatham moved on. We
                            reached <name type="place">Tullahoma</name> late in
                            the evening of the 28th tired and almost worn
                            out.</p>
                        <p>Everything seemed to have the move on it but the
                            wagon train.</p>
                        <p>On our march here, we would halt, march, skirmish and
                            halt in the rain and mud.</p>
                        <p>The rains were almost incessant, and at times very
                            hard. The enemy had kept moving and so that we, to
                            keep pace with him. They were approaching <name
                                type="place">Tullahoma</name> in force, and from
                            indications Bragg intended to give battle.</p>
                        <p>Early Tuesday morning June the 30th troops were seen
                            by the thousands hurrying in all directions through
                            and around the town, getting into positions in the
                            ditches.</p>

                        <p>Generals, the Lieut Gen, commanding directs that you
                            furnish the necessary detail from your divisions to
                            Captain W.J. Morris to throw up breast works were

                        <p>Respectfully<lb/>Thos M. Jack<lb/>Asst Adj Gen.</p>
                        <p>We lay all day and night in the ditches in the mud,
                            without shelter from the pelting rain. We had
                            nothing to eat, nor had we all day. The boys began
                            to get wrathy and hot, but the rain which kept
                            falling in continuous showers kept us cool. Generals
                            and men all fared alike in these ditches. During one
                            of the hardest rains that fell the writer
                            saw<lb/>Gen Cheatham on a stump<lb/>Sitting as
                            complacently as if the sun was shining, with one
                            shoe off, and one of his big toes sticking out
                            through a hole in his sock.</p>
                        <p>The enemy presented only a small force in our front
                            line, White the main force of his army hurried on to
                            our right flank, thus forcing Bragg from <name

                            the men, of the anxiously expected battle, which

                        <p>We left the ditches July 1st at day light, and went
                            in the direction of Cowan. The boys were mad and
                            wetter than "wet hens." We do not know whether thir
                            ruffled tempers were due to being wet and
                                <orig>mudy</orig> or to the fact the "Yanks" had

                            <p>General= The enemy have reached your front close
                                up. The question to be decided instantly, Shall
                                we fight at the "Elk" or shall we take position
                                at the foot of the Mountain at Cowan.
                                Answer.</p>

                            <p>Allirona July 1st 8.PM.</p>
                            <p>Gen Mackall: You ask, "Shall we fight on the Elk
                                or take position at the foot of the Mountain at
                                Cowan." In reply take position at the foot of
                                the Mountain at Cowan. In that case I think as
                                much of the wagon train as possible should be
                                throuwn over the Mountain, and a supply of grain
                                ordered up by railroad for the Animals we must
                                retain on this side</p>

                        <p>Arriving Gen Polk formed line of battle, and all the
                            wagon trains were hurried across the mountain, and
                            all the troops, except Polks Corps and Wheeler's
                            Cavalry. There was no fighting.</p>
                        <p>That Bragg was moving to avoid and engagement was
                            very evident. After all the wagon trains, artillery
                            and troops had crossed over to the other side of the
                            mountain, save Polk's Corps and Wheeler's Cavalry,
                            Polk's men began climbing the mountain's steep and
                            rugged side. Cheatham's division was the last to
                            begin the <orig>assent</orig>, and that directly
                            over the tunnel. The Cavalry still battling with the
                            enemy's vanguard. After a long and tiresome pull up
                            the mountain, we camped on its top near "University
                            Place," July 3d Friday night.</p>
                        <p>Gen Polk camp with Gen Cheatham that night near our
                            brigade. Since we had left the Shelbyville pike, the
                            enemy had kept pressing us hard by day, and with but
                            little relenting at night. It seemed the aim of the
                            enemy, by his incessant pursuit, was either <note>

                            stores, and there by his probable capture might
                            result.</p>
                        <p>If such was their aim, they made a complete failure.
                            At 8 oclock that night Gen Polk received the
                            following dispatch from Gen Wheeler, who was still
                            at the foot or nearly so of the mountain.</p>

                                very warmly at this point, now after dark. Our
                                men are maintaining their groung bravely. The
                                enemy have infantry and cavalry and are
                                evidently reinforcing.</p>

                        <p>Leaving our encampment on the top of the mountain
                            early next morning, we descended the eastern slope
                            of the Cumberland and hastened on to the river.</p>
                        <p>All the Army that had proceeded Polk and Wheeler had
                            crossed the river, part on the R.R. Bridge at
                            Bridgeport and part on pontoon at the mouth of
                            "Battle Creek." We crossed on the pontoon. Wither's
                            division after crossing the river moved out to White
                            sides, while Cheatham halted at "Shell Mound."
                            Cheatham had brought up the rear to the river and
                            there ended the pursuit, and the river remained the
                            picket line for both Armies for some time.</p>

                    <p>On the <date when="1863-07-07">7th day of July
                            1863</date>, Bragg's tired and almost worn out Army
                        entered <name type="place">Chattanooga</name> after a
                        long and remarkable march from Middle Tenn. The enemy
                        had pressed us so closely we experienced a feeling of
                        relief when we put the Tennessee river between us and
                        sat down around <name type="place">Chattanooga</name> to
                        enjoy a quiet rest. Cheatham's division left the pike
                        some ten miles out from Shelbyville, made the march
                        through rain and mud, halting and marching, forming
                        lines of battle in ditches and out of ditches, pressed
                        day and night by a relentless foe; yet we came into
                            <name type="place">Chattanooga</name> without the
                        loss of a single gun or a pound of Quartermaster's or
                        Commisary's stores or a round of ordinance, save what
                        was given to the citizens at Shelbyville as we were
                        leaving. Although there were some wounded and some were
                        taken sick on the way, yet our division made the march
                        and went into camp with four hundreed more men, than we
                        started with. Here around <name type="place"
                            >Chattanooga</name> we had little to do save build
                        fortifications.</p>
                    <p>For one week the Old 19th Tenn slept on the hill above
                        and overlooking the "Boat landing," on a high bluff
                        where we threw up fortifications.</p>

                            soldiers remained &amp; Maj CW Heiskell was one of
                            them. The Federals kept shelling the city at
                            intervals all day. One amongst the first shells
                            thrown exploding wounded a little girl breaking her
                            leg. And ou of this sad accident there came near
                            being a sad affair in our division and in our
                            regiment.</p>

                        <p>A Challenge.</p>
                        <p>The Father of our Lieut Col B.F. Moore was living
                            near the city at the time, and had in his home
                            several sick, in fact his home was full. The wounded
                            little girl was taken to Mr. Moore's home but was
                            refused admitance for want of room. Brig Gen Smith
                            of Cheathams division being present at the time made
                            some unkind remarks about Mr. Moore. These remarks
                            reaching the ears of our Lieut Colonel, he asked an
                            explanation of Gen Smith about the remark he should
                            have made about his Father. To Col Moore's mind no
                            satisfactory explanation was made, and he challenged
                            Gen Smith for a duel, which was accepted. By a
                            agreement Gen Smith, Lieut Col Moore and Maj. C.W.
                            Hinkell met in Col Moore's tent, where Maj Hinkell
                            poured oil on the troubled waters, and the two brave
                            officers separated good friends. The bombardment of
                            the city created considerable excitement in the
                            city, and activity in camp. For several days, at
                            intervals they continued to shell the city. Our
                            brigade <del rend="strikethrough">was</del> was
                            ordered out on duty about the 29 September.</p>

                        <p>Leaving Lafayette that evening, we took position a
                            short distance beyond Rock Spring Church on the
                            Crawfish Spring road. Hindman's division was posted
                            on the right of us in the direction of Pea Vine
                            Creek. The next day Cheatham moved out to Lee &amp;
                            Gordon's Mills, and on reaching the top of the
                            ridge, over looking the bottoms in front of the
                            mill, our brigade was thrown forward as a skirmish

                            exchanged and a little picket firing. We returned to
                            Rock Spring where we remained untill the 18th

                        <p>During the night of the 18th Bragg had crossed his
                                <orig>Vetran</orig> Army and formed his lines,
                            with Rosencrans in his front, and the bounding
                            turbulent Chickamauga with but few places to cross
                            at his back. All had crossed but Cheatham's
                            division, which had remained on the south or east
                            side of the creek, until the next morning the 19th
                            while we had not marched very far yet we were
                            without rations, depending upon our supply train,
                            which failed to come up.</p>

                        <p>The general surface of the battlefield was so rough
                            and so heavely timbered that the two armies lay
                            during the night in closer proximity than perhaps
                            they supposed. Rosencrans had all the advantage as
                            to position, as he picked his own ground, giving
                            Bragg only room enough to form between him and the
                            Chickamauga over which he could not have crossed
                            with his army with success to prevent capture, had
                            he been defeated. While Rosencrans, in case he
                            should be defeated had all the roads open and free
                            in his rear.</p>
                        <p>He had unquestionably the advantage as to numbers, he
                            having from 65,000 to <gap reason="illegible"
                                resp="nl"/> while Bragg had about 60,000
                            men.</p>
                        <p>Saturday morning came in bright and clear, and the
                            glittering bayonets on the Rebel gunsfreflected in
                            the sun light presaged no retreat - victory or
                            death. Cheatham's division left its bivouac early
                            Saturday morning, and crossed the Chickamauga at
                            Hunt's bridge, a rude construction for farm use,
                            about one mile below Lee &amp; Gordon's Mills, moved
                            rapidly to the front, to our right, where from
                            Walker's guns the red tide of battle began, and was
                            rolling down the line to our left, while the even
                            roar of musketry broken only by the loud peals from
                            the iron mouthed cannons, showed clearly the battle
                            had opened in earnest. We double quicked through the
                            woods, and the rough ground which threw our regiment
                            out of line.</p>

                        <p>While we were yet standing, Gen Cheatham came riding
                            rapidly along in front of our line, saying "Give
                            them hell boys, give them hell." He was not out of
                            sight, and scarcely out of hearing had there been no
                            roar of battle, when Gen Polk came in full tilt upon
                            his heels saying, "Give them what Cheatham says, we
                            will pay off old chores to day."</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the tumult and uproar of battle, the
                            bursting of shells, the cracking of grape and minnie
                            balls against the trees, there went up a "Rebel
                            Yell" that vied with the roar of battle. Just as Gen
                            Polk passed our regiment, two of Co "A" who were
                            standing at the head of the regiment leaning against
                            and on opposite sides of a small black Jack, a

                            this tree just between the two men but did not

                        <p>Cheatham had been ordered to the assistance of Gen
                            Walker who had opened the battle and had been
                            engaged some time against stubborn force <del

                            assulted in front and on both flanks. When Cheatham
                            struck the advancing enemy, he not only checked his
                            advance but drove him back. There was a small

                            which was a thick growth. Over this spot of ground
                            both Armies had been, and each had left their dead
                            and wounded to mark the<lb/>Illfated Spot.</p>

                            long, and until the late hour at night, that the air

                            enemy the morning before. Each army

                            and forth over the same field repeatedly. And nought

                            the suffering, some calling for water, some for

                        <p>Our boys were silent and thoughtful, ready to take
                            what ever the "Fates" decreed.</p>
                        <p>The night next morning a dense fog from the
                            Chickamauga mingled with the smoke of
                                <orig>Satturday's</orig> battle, covered all the
                            valley. Through this fog and smoke<lb/>The Sun
                            veiling his face,<lb/>looked as if made of blood,
                            thus presaging an other baptism of fire that was to
                            dye the field of battle a deeper crimson.
                                <orig>Somhow</orig> it seemed to have infused
                            new life into our men, for after the sleeplessness
                            and silence of the night came life and activity. The
                            lines of both Armies had been shortened during the
                            night, and the boys were ready and waiting for the
                            coming struggle, which was soon to wake the echoes
                            from the hill to hill, and carry with it hundreds
                            more of noble and brave men into Death's capacious
                            maw.</p>
                        <p>Orders had been given to open the battle at the break
                            of day, but from some cause, it was 8 or 9 oclock
                            before the first sound of conflict was heard, when
                            it came rolling down the line as it did, from right
                            to left, the morning before.</p>
                        <p>Gen Polk opened the attack this morning with intense
                            fury. The enemy had prepared breast works behind
                            which they intended to fight that day, but our men
                            charged them with desperate determination to take
                            and hold them.</p>
                        <p>The boys looked with indifference upon what ever the
                            enemy had made for their protection not intending to
                            fight behind works, <note>
                                <add>they</add>
                            </note> did not make any. But what ever they took
                            shelter behind, our boys intend to drive them from
                            it.</p>

                        <p> The fighting this morning was<lb/>A death
                            struggle.</p>
                        <p>The tug of war was between two brave armies. The
                            bravery of such men, the determination to win or
                            die, banished all fear. All along the line our men
                            pressed forward yielding no ground. So desperate was
                            the conflict in several places a hand to hand fight
                            was waged, and the clashe of bayonets were heard.
                                <name type="person">Gen Hood</name> broke the
                            enemy's line at or near the Brotheston house where
                            he received a <choice>

                            </choice> wound in the leg, which necessitated the
                            amputation of the limb.</p>
                        <p>From this position on our left, the enemy were driven
                            back to the Crawfish Spring road below the Widow
                            Glen's. <name type="person">Longstreet</name> was
                            now driving the enemy's right, around like a barn
                            dorr, while all along great chasms were being made
                            in his lines. So dreadful now was the storm of
                            battle, and the deadly fire of the Confederate guns
                            who surged forward like an ocean of fire <note>

                            </note> the right wing of the enemy could not stand
                            it. Hindman's division swung around on the spurs of
                            Mission Ridge, when he had men killed by being
                            pierced with the bayonet. Here he captured about
                            twelve hundred (1,200) <orig>prisners</orig>.</p>

                        <p>But not so with his left, where Thomas had been
                            driven back to an elevation near the Snodgrass
                            residence. Here Rosencrans had reinforced Thomas,
                            who having such a strong position held his ground
                            against repeated attempts to Bragg to dislodge him,
                            until night fall, when he abandoned the field,
                            leaving the battle field of Chickamauga in our hands
                            with all that a battlefield claims.</p>
                        <p>Thus ended one of the greatest battles of the War <note>

                            each lost about one third 1/3 of his army 331/3
                            percent. In this battle the old 19th Tenn lost about
                            40% of her men.</p>
                        <p>Of the Generals, Maj Gen Hood lost a leg, Maj Gen

                            his iron column of Rebels through the city and take
                            it.</p>
                        <p>In his flight from the field of Chickamauga, he left
                            all his dead and wounded that he did not get into

                            Bragg's tardiness in pressing the pursuit, gave
                            Rosencrans time to compose himself, and form a line
                            of defense around the city about one and a half
                            miles out. This was Bragg's way of doing, he would
                            gain the victory, drive in his nails, but would not
                            clinch them, and soon the enemy would redraw the

                            swords, knapsacks, and accouterments. Caissons,

                        <p>Others we saw dying rejoicing in the <orig>ful</orig>
                            hope of a glorious immortality. One happy Christian,
                            we saw as we were passing, lying on the ground with
                            a rock for a pillow, wounded so badly that the
                            surgeons had passed him by as being beyond any
                            possible hope of benefit, dying. Exhorting every one
                            around, and all, whose eye he would catch to become
                            Christian, he would put the pertinent questions "Are
                            you a Christian," "Do you love Jesus." There were
                            many of this kind bath of the Blue and the Gray, we
                            could go on and mention of the scenes of a similar
                            character, but we must desist.</p>
                        <p>Bragg followed the enemy slowly and closely and
                            established his lines around <name type="place"
                                >Chattanooga</name> parallel to those of
                            Rosencrans.</p>
                        <p>Bragg and Rosencrans settled down to work with pick
                            and spade directly under each others guns with all
                            their might, as if preparing a grave each one for
                            the other. Bragg kept pushing the enemy's lines in
                            on the city until he held the river from Lookout
                            point to about half way to the city, and from <name
                                type="person">Sherman</name> heights to the
                            river above. For days the Videtts of each army stood
                            in two hundred yards of, and gazed at each other
                            like grim monsters.</p>
                        <p>The valley around and out from <name type="place"
                                >Chattanooga</name> was litteraly blockaded with
                            breast works, and plowed up with rifle pits. The
                            crest of <name type="place">Missionary ridge</name>,
                            its base and sides were furrowed with rifle pits and
                            covered with cannon. Every now and then from the
                            summit of <name type="place">Lookout Mountain</name>
                            were sent savage hissing shells which would fall and
                            burst in the camp of the enemy. For days the pickets
                            of each army sat in their "Gopher" pits cracking
                            jokes with each other, while from the top of <name
                                type="place">Missionary ridge</name> and the
                            rocky peak of Lookout went shrieking messengers of
                            death over their heads unnoticed and uncared for by
                            them, while the signal flags from the mountaintops
                            talked with each other in their silent way over the
                            enemy's camps.</p>

                        <p>A strange scene.</p>
                        <p>A peculiar scene is here presented in the two
                            encampments of supposed hostile foes. Both armies
                            under the range of a single shot. The bands of the
                            two Armies played for the entertainment of each
                            other. Sweet notes of "Dixie" were wafted towards
                            the city, over the encampment of the enmy &amp;
                            these were met on the way by those of "Yankee
                            Doodle" coming over to us. An other uncommon
                                <orig>feture</orig> of these two encampments,
                            was while the enemy could plainly see the men and
                            officers moving around Bragg's headquarters and
                            along the tops of the ridge, we in turn from the top
                            of Lookout and the ridge with glasses could see what
                            the "Yankees" had for dinner. While here Bragg had
                            detailed a special Secret Scout. For what purpose or
                            whither they went no one but the detail ever

                            our division (Cheatham's) was ordered to Tiner's a
                            station on the <abbr>ET.Va&amp;Ga RR</abbr>.</p>
                        <p>We moved out in one of the hardest rains of the
                            season, feeling our way through the gloom and
                            darkness of the night which seemed almost
                            inpenetrable. Over the rough ridges through the the
                            dark and muddy hollows we went, and reached the
                            station, cold and wet, and took the cars for <name

                        <p>Our brigade took the middle section and moved out an
                            on without a hitch or jar, until somewhere above
                                <name type="place">Cleveland</name>, where two
                            cars of the front section broke loose, started back

                            in the end of and split one of the cars open.</p>
                        <p>The sudden jar, when it struck, knocked off a good
                            many of the men on our section, who in turn hallooed
                            to the rest on the train, "Jump the rear train is
                            right on you." And such and other jumping out of
                            cars, the writer one of them. Those on top of the
                            cars seeing there was no danger, remained. No one
                            was hurt except from jumping. <note>

                            </note> was hurt a little, having fallen on his back
                            instead of his feet.</p>
                        <p>We moved on, reaching <name type="place"
                                >Charleston</name>, where the bridge having been
                            burned, we left the cars. On our arrival here we
                            found Gen Stevenson's division, who had prepared
                            temporary crossing, a rude kind of pontoon bridge
                            across the Hiwassee river.</p>
                        <p>We could cross only in single file, but were soon
                            over, and moved on up the road as far as <name
                                type="place">sweetwater</name>, where we halted
                            and remained two days. Here we had issued us what
                            the boys called "Sick flour," from which we made
                            biscuit. Having no lard or grease of any kind, our
                            biscuits were made up with salt and water.</p>
                        <p>Of all the sick boys for a while we had not seen
                            since our "Goose Creek" episode, where honey became
                            too sweet to be good. Our biscuits were so hard we
                            saw several of the boys gouge holes in the biscuits
                            and fill them with powder and blow them open, so, as
                            they said, they could be eaten. While we were here,
                            Gen Longstreet came up took our place, and being
                            relieved we retraced our steps to <name type="place"

                        <p>Sunday morning <date when="1863-11-22">Nov 22d</date>
                            Rufus Lamb and my self went upon Lookout point where
                            we had a grand view of the encampments of both
                            Armyies. The enemy's two pontoons, one below
                            Lookout, the other in front of the city, were in
                            plain view. Walthrall's brigade, of 1,300 men, was
                            around on the west side of the mountain. They had
                            only two pieces of Artillery. We were on Lookout
                            nearly all day. Hooker's men who were in the valley
                            just beyond were in plain view, and were on the move
                            all the time. Taking advantage of the bushes, and
                            the spurs of the hills to obscure their
                            movements.</p>
                        <p>They were maneuvering for an attack on "Point
                            Lookout." They had a battery of four guns, on one of
                            the knolls across the river from Lookout which kept
                            up a constant shelling of the point all evening.
                            This battery was near the toe of the Moccasin. We
                            had quite often to take shelter behind the large
                            ledges of rock projected some several feet high.</p>

                            day. He reached the <name>Craven House</name> about
                            4 P.M.</p>
                        <p>Before night a heavy fog cloud that had gathered down
                            the mountain, and was too heavy to scale the
                            mountain's misty top, moved up the mountain towards
                            the river, and enveloped the men as they fought,
                            shutting all view of the battle save the flash of
                            their guns. And for this the fight was
                            called<lb/>The battle above the clouds.</p>
                        <p>The battle lasted until long after dark. The ground
                            was so rough <note>

                            </note> it was with difficulty you could mark the
                            line between them. The whole side of the mountain
                            was covered with men firing from behind trees and
                            rocks. The flash of their guns resembeled fire
                            flies. Our division lay in the Valley and watched
                            the battle above the clouds.</p>
                        <p>That night was clear and frosty. About ten oclock,
                            the moon being a little below the zenith passed
                            through an almost total <orig>Eclips</orig>. We had
                            not yet been to sleep and we lay out on the ground
                            and watched the moon as she passed through the
                            shadow of the earth.</p>

                        <p>As the old town clock on the City Hall struck the
                            hour of one at night, the whole of Bragg's Army
                            could have been seen moving for the crest of
                            Missionary Ridge to form a new line of battle.</p>
                        <p>Our brigade left its ditches in the valley and formed
                            line along the top of the ridge about two hundred
                            yards from Gen Braggs head quarters. In forming our
                            lines, we put one line as skirmishers at the foot of
                            the ridge, and had only a single line on the top.
                            Our two lines, the one at the foot and the other on
                            top of the ridge, were so deployed <note>

                        <p>Out to our right, and out in front of Bragg's
                            headquarters, was a knoll which the Federals had
                            covered with cannon, and from these batteries they <note>

                        <p>The Sun, as it mounted the ninth hour of its watch,
                            taking in the grand review, saw quite a difference
                            in the two Armies as they lay in unrest, waiting for
                            the coming conflict.</p>
                        <p>Bragg's Army not its former self, depleted by the
                            battle of Chickamauga had not been strenthened by
                            reinforcements.</p>
                        <p>Gregg and others had been returned to Johnson and
                            Longstreet had been detached and sent to <name
                                type="place">Knoxville</name>. Bragg had but a
                            hand full compared with the swell army of
                            Rosencrans. the latter had been reinforced, and the
                            wear and tear had been more than made good by large
                            reinforcements.</p>
                        <p>While we were on the top of Missionary ridge
                            earnestly watching the busy maneuvering of the
                            enemy, there was one of the Old 19th who for the
                            first time was observed sitting a few steps away
                            alone, and seemingly unconscious of the excitement
                            that was then moving and agitating Bragg's whole
                            Army.</p>

                            coursing his veins, he would have severed every

                            power. There he sat, quietly waiting the decrees of
                            the inexorable "Fates," wholy oblivious of his
                            surroundings. About noon Col Moore's Father came up
                            to our regiment, and the Col gave to him every thing
                            he had about his person, his knife, comb, money,
                            watch, etc. The battle had not yet opened, but the
                            enemy was maneuvering his thousands before the
                            skirmish line of the Confederates.</p>

                            music as if the precursor of the coming storm. Bragg
                            had the heaviest part of his line on the right,
                            while his left was strung out until it presented

                            grandly came on down the ridge towards us and rolled
                            across the valley like a wave at high tide. The
                            enemy made a vigorous assault on our right, but our

                            skirmish line. We counted right in our front four
                            double columns of the enemy, all moving directly
                            against our brigade of a single line. These columns
                            of the enemy seemed to us to be not more than
                            seventy or a hundred yard apart. In front of our
                            regiment at the foot of the ridge, was a small field
                            not more than fifty yards wide, across this these
                            four columns had to pass. On the Federals came with
                            that determined step that defied all opposition. Our

                            as thick as stumps in a new ground. Several of the
                            lines at that foot of the hill never reached the
                            top. Whether they were killed or captured we never
                            knew. Those who did reach the top came amid a shower
                            of bullets that plowed the ground and skined the
                            trees all around them. The air between the ridge and
                            Orchard Knob was filled with shot and shells. The
                            ridge where we were was quite steep but the enemy
                            came on crawling up the steep ascent like bugs <note>

                            way. Our men fell back to a spur of the ridge,
                            leaving the top under a most galling fire, passing
                            down the slope and across an open field to our new
                            position on this spur.</p>

                            we checked and held them for a short time. They
                            charged us from the front and at the same time a
                            column of the enemy was moving to our left flank and

                            forcing Bragg from the Ridge, and across the

                            back, and the Federals had just gained the tops of
                            the ridge and had lined the fence.</p>
                        <p>We tarried not, nor did we loiter by the way, for the
                            enemy's vanguard in a measure was our rear guard,
                            they no doubt captured every now and then some of
                            our men who happened to straggle too far behind. We
                            did not rush but moved slowly on account of our
                            wagon train, so that the enemy kept close upon
                            us.</p>
                        <p>As we retreated and showed no disposition of
                            resistance, the enemy became more bold, causing us
                            to halt and form line of battle more than once,

                            Gen Bragg issued his last orders to the men he had
                            commanded for the last eighteen months, and whome he
                            had led in several hard fought battles. He was
                            endeared to the men by sharing with them the
                            hardships and toils of army life, the long marches
                            by day and by night, through rain and sunshine, heat

                            crowding upon his memory it was with feelings of

                            driven back and back by our foes, until our homes
                            were now in their hands, and at their mercy. When
                            Gen Brag left, his mantle fell, for a short time on
                            the shoulders of Lieut Gen Hardee; who in taking

                        <p>As we approached our new quarters, we passed
                            Jackson's brigade, by whom we pitched our tents.</p>
                        <p>The first thing that attracted our attention was
                            stocks in Jackson brigade <del rend="strikethrough"
                                >and</del> in which was imprisoned a man. Our
                            brigade was furiously indignant at the idea of a man
                            being punished in any such manner. So after dark on
                            the first night of our arrival, it being clear and
                            frosty the moon shining brightly, some fifty or an
                            hundred of our brigade made an invasion on Jackson's
                            stocks.</p>

                        <p>While the writer took no part in it, curiosity
                            carried him along to see the fun. Jackson's men did
                            not like the Stocks any more than did we, yet they
                            did not like this invasion of their premises and
                            they rose to a man in defence of the eye sore of
                            their brigade. Quickly the men were in line by
                            companies and moved to the scene of the excitement.
                            The alarm being given we scattered. The writer
                            dodged under the shadow of one of the cabins, just
                            as a company filed by him and made his escape. They
                            captured three or four of our men and kept them in
                            the guard house all night. The next morning our men
                            demanded the release of the prisoners, which was
                            refused.</p>
                        <p>Before the officers of our regiment were aware of the
                            trouble our men were falling into line with their
                            guns to attack the guard house, and to shoot if
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>Jackson's men gave up the prisoners and every thing
                            became as quiet as if nothing had happened.</p>
                        <p>One month from this time, the stocks were seen
                            staring our own men in the face, and in them our men
                            were placed, without much kicking.</p>
                        <p>How readly we adapt ourselves through habit to
                            surrounding circumstances, no matter how obnoxious

                        <p>Next morning Gen Cheatham and about one third of our
                            brigade took on a "Hight tight," and we had a lively
                            time in the streets of <name type="place"
                                >Atlanta</name> that day. The men ran after
                            Cheatham calling him "Mars Frank" and begging him to
                            make them a <orig resp="nl">speach</orig>. The
                            General would say "Ah! Go away my boys," but the
                            boys kept after him. As the Gen would reach the
                            corner of a block, he would be headed off by an
                            other squad, as anxious to hear him make a <orig
                                resp="nl">speach</orig> as the men in pursuit.
                            All he could say <note>

                            </note> "Come along, You are all my boys."</p>
                        <p>If there ever was a Gen and his men of whom it could
                            be said the men belonged to the General, and the
                            General belonged to the men, it was Gen Cheatham and
                            his division. Leaving <name type="place"
                                >Atlanta</name> the next morning we moved out
                            for West point which we reached at four oclock
                            Sunday morning. We remained here all day, and having
                            an opportunity to <orig resp="nl">atten</orig>
                            church we took it in, both in the morning and at
                            night.</p>
                        <p>Leaving here Monday morning we went to Montgomery
                            where we went <orig>abord</orig> the steamer
                            "Reindeer" for Selma. Here we again took the cars
                            for <name type="place">Demopolis</name> where we met
                            Gen Polk, and where we remained for three or four
                            days. Just what was the object of our trip, remained
                            in the bosom of our commanders. We saw nothing nor
                            did we hear anything to call us to this point. Gen
                            Polk told us he wanted Cheatham's division with him
                            again and wished we could stay. But this was not our
                            place on the war's great chess board.</p>

                            a dozen of each regiment. Then one by one joined,
                            then they fell in by the score and soon each brigade
                            was in line, one against the other.</p>
                        <p>Then falling in by regiments and brigades, Cheathams

                        <p>Regular military maneuvers were observed, first one
                            side then the other would charge. The line of battle
                            was nearly a mile long. It was a friendly and
                            exciting contest, lasting until noon. There were a
                            few hurt. In the excitement and hurry, a rock
                            unintentionally would be gathered up and thrown with
                            the snow.</p>
                        <p>The snow balling lasted about three and a half or

                        <p>Sham battles</p>
                        <p>About April 1st Johnson fought to or three sham
                            battles below <name type="place">Dalton</name>. He
                            had one or two divisions on each side and in which
                            the Artillery played a conspicuous part. When the
                            first one was fought our division knew nothing about
                            it. Our men were lounging around in camp, some
                            asleep.</p>
                        <p>When the firing opened by brigades, and the cannons <note>
                                <add place="above">opened</add>
                            </note> you never saw men move more quickly in
                            getting their guns and accoutrements, and ready to
                            fall into line at the first command. We thought the
                            enemy had surprised some portion of Army, as the
                            sound of battle came from the direction of the
                            front. A few days later Cheatham's <choice>

                                <corr resp="nl">Cleburne</corr>
                            </choice>'s and Bate's divisions, with their
                            respective artillery formed on the hill sides &amp;
                            valley below the city and fought their sham battle.
                            There were Ladies from <name type="place"
                                >Dalton</name>, <name type="place"
                                >Atlanta</name> and other points present to
                            witness the battle. They were just around on the
                            hills out of danger. There were two opposing forces
                            formed, and each maneuvered for position.</p>
                        <p>Skirmish lines engaged first, then the main attacks.
                            Artillery duels were quite lively.</p>
                        <p>After these were over, the respective chaplains began
                            a forward movement in their work. A revival spirit
                            took hold of the men as well their ministers, and
                            each brigade had its "Bush Arbor." Many were being
                            saved, conversions every night. Each brigade had its
                            own Arbor, and as the brigades were close together,
                            each night could be heard singing and shouting from
                            four brigade Arbors at the same time.</p>

                                resp="nl">cahaplain</orig> of a Middle Tenn
                            regiment, conducted the meeting in our brigade.
                            Father McCutchin was a Cumberland minister. Blessed
                            old man, he is in Heaven today, for he was then an
                            old man.</p>
                        <p>Maneys brigade was about half a mile from ours. In
                            clearing off the ground for their Arbor, they had
                            left standign close by the arber a tall hickory tree
                            with scarcely a limb on it and to all appearances
                            perfectly sound. They had swept some trash up
                            against the this tree and had partly burned it, but
                            no one had thought the tree had burned any at all.
                            The meeting had been going on for some time and much
                            interest <note>

                        <p>On the night of April the 29th there were hundreds
                            under the Arbor, and about forty penitents.</p>
                        <p>At one bench were eight penitents and two were
                            talking to them, all were kneeling, when with no
                            more warning than a sharp crack, or snap of the
                            tree, it came crashing through the Arbor and fell
                            along side of this bench<lb/> Killing the ten at
                            once.</p>
                        <p>This came like an explosion in the deep world of
                            thought with the soldier whose hearts of adamant had
                            not been moved for years. They began to show every
                            sign of unrest, and began to look out beyond the
                            sunset of this life, and to think of the life
                            beyond.</p>

                        <p>The Funeral.</p>
                        <p>It was a sad scene the next day, as the long column
                            of soldiers moved in solum procession headed by the
                            band playing a muffled funeral march, closely
                            followed by ten Ambulances each one bearing its
                            dead, to where ten open graves were waiting their
                            reception.</p>
                        <p>These men, who had just burried their dead comrades
                            had in days gone by burried upon the battle field,
                            hundreds of their fellow men, piling them in ditches
                            one upon an other with seeming indifference. But
                            here their stout hearts were bowed in deep sorrow,
                            as they laid away beneath the cold sands of the
                            grave, these their comrades and bid them adieu until
                            the morning of the resurrection.</p>
                        <p>The next day the old 19th laid away one of Co "G" who
                            died with congestive chills. The following died

                        <p>Taking it all in all, we had a nice time while we

                            self, and wake up from his long winter nap and throw
                            out his arms feeling for "Johnnie Rebs."</p>
                        <p>He seemed intent on pushing Johnson from his present
                            quarters. But he found our General wide awake. Like
                            Davy Crocket, Johnson slept with one eye open and
                            was never caught napping.</p>
                        <p>Gen Hood who lost a leg in the Chickamauga battle,
                            had returned and had taken charge of his command.
                            While we were here sergt John Richards and George
                            Cheek went over to Spring Place a small village
                            twelve miles east of <name type="place"
                                >Dalton</name> and conscripted on William Garner
                            and brought him to the regiment. They did this with
                            expectation of getting a furlough, but as the enemy
                            began pressing our front Johnson countermanded the
                            order giving furloughs, so Garner joined their Co
                            "H" and remained with them. <date when="1864-05-08"

                            ordered in double quick time to "Dug Gap" some four

                            an exceedingly hard march, having double quicked
                            nearly all the way to the foot of the ridge, and
                            then we climbed along the steep road when we reached
                            the top nearly exhausted. On our way up the ridge we
                            passed several calvalrymen wounded at a Spring.</p>
                        <p>Hookers command was in plain view and near the Gap on
                            the other side. After dark their camp firese filled
                            all the valley beyond. We formed our line along on
                            top of the ridge. For some time after we had formed
                            our line, the enemy's Artillery sent shot after shot
                            scalping the crest of the ridge. Soon after dark the
                            skirmishing ceased and all around us became quiet
                            and our ears were again greeted with some sweet
                            musick from the Federal bands, which made us wish<lb/>

                        <p>Our regiment occupied the summit of Rocky face. We
                            threw up or piled up rocks for the protection of our
                            heads behind which we had to lie down in order to
                            get even that protection. The enemy's bullets were
                            coming pretty thick and fast, and now and then they
                            would find their way through the rock wall and wound
                            our boys, and generally in the head and face. Their
                            skirmish line was at the foot of the ridge. Just at

                            enemy's line was an opening in the bushes, as if it

                            the bushes on each side very thick. We were lying
                            down looking through an opening in the rock wall,
                            when one of the enemy's pickets started across this

                            bullet went through his body. We were watching him.
                            Soon as he fell two others came out to pick him up
                            and in doing so they too fell and lay by his

                        <p>Polk formed on the left and below the town with his

                            the right and almost to the Connasauga river above

                        <p>Our boys were on tip toe in their frenzy of
                            excitement and like the old war horse, could hardly
                            be restrained with bit and <orig resp="nl"
                                >bridal</orig>. The enemy all evening kept
                            inching along closer and closer to our lines, while
                            our officers kept down the inclination on the part
                            of our men to drive them back. That night the two
                            Armies lay in line of battle close to each other and
                            ready for the fray the next morning.</p>
                        <p>Heavy skirmishing commenced next morning on our left
                            with Polk against McPherson. Soon the whole line was
                            engaged. Hardee against Hooker and Polk against Cox.
                            Our <orig resp="nl">brigad</orig> engaged Baird and
                            Jefferson C. Davis in the desperate charge the enemy
                            made against Cheatham. The fighting between Hardee
                            and Hooker was heavy indeed, the musketry and cannon
                            played almost incessantly for two hours. Our ears
                            were greeted with boom bang, zip, zip so long that
                            after it had subsided still the roar of battle
                            continued in our ears.</p>
                        <p>Hood on our right drove the Federal lines around,
                            doubling them up column on column, until the enemy
                            reinforced and checked Hood's advance. Hundreds of
                            cannons in the two armies were playing upon each
                            other from one end of the battle lines to the other,
                            till the woods and fields were thick <orig resp="nl"

                                >missils</orig> of shot and shell. The battle
                            continued until dark put and end to the strife. The
                            two armies again lay in line as the night found
                            them. There was little change of position on either
                            side during the night.</p>

                        <p>The center of the two armies the morning of the 15th
                            seemed to be the attraction of the war God's fury.
                            Hooker made a most savage charge on Cheatham, coming
                            in solid phalanx by brigade, one after an other, but
                            they were driven back like a wave following wave,
                            until they reached the point of starting. The loss
                            of the enemy was plainly visible, the field lay
                            strewn with their dead and wounded.</p>
                        <p>The colors of the Old 19th were on the front line,
                            amid this storm of shot and shell, guarded and kept

                                >Resaca</name> we were standing by the road

                            stood a cabin by the road side, in which were two
                            women and three children. There was only skirmishing
                            going on. The enemy in our front some quarter or
                            half mile, opened a battery with this cabin in its
                            range. The first shot passed over the cabin and
                            exploded in the distance. The second shot burst in

                            screaming at the top of their voices. The shells

                        <p>Cleburne had good breast works with head logs behind
                            which he lay quietly awaiting.</p>
                        <p>As the enemy advanced, Cleburne held his fire, and
                            but for the Confederate flags floating above the
                            head logs, there was nothing to show that the
                            Confederate ditches were not deserted.</p>
                        <p>The enemy advanced slowly and with a firm step,
                            expecting the Confederate guns to open on them every
                            moment. Yet when they were within a few yards of
                            Cleburne's ditches every thing seemed as still as
                            death.</p>
                        <p>No one, none but God ever knew the fearful emotions
                            of their souls and with what trepidation of heart
                            they now advanced. They could not but have known and
                            doubless felt that there was a Confederate gun,
                            which was the fact, pointing with deadly aim at each
                            and every morn. Yet on they came. Was this bravery?
                            There "Spartans" were laid in the shade! Now they
                            are only a few feet from the ditches in, there rings
                            out on the stillness of the air the command of
                            Cleburne, "Now men fire." Like a flash of blinding
                            ligtning with a tremendous peal of deafening thunder
                            there went up from under the head logs of <choice>

                            Who could have stood? No Spartan of old, could have
                            remained under this red hot rain of lead. But few of
                            Howard's men who composed that front line returned.
                            That one volly laid upon the ground dead and wounded
                            more than one thousand brave men.</p>

                            and that evening Col Lamb of the 5th Tenn of our
                            brigade was killed. There had been one continous

                            and Cleburne, and soon after charged that of Bate.
                            The fighting continued until day light, amidst a
                            continued fall of rain. We had to remain in the
                            ditches, when some times there were two inches of

                            three divisions, which placed Hardee on the right,
                            Hood in the center and Polk on the left. There was a

                            the top of Kennesaw Mountain. This new line again
                            placed Hardee in the center, and Cheatham's division
                            along over Pine mountain. Along on this line, as was

                            were riding down the line, inspecting that of the
                            enemy's as well as our own. On reaching Pine
                            Mountain at a point of nice observation held by our
                            (Strahl's) brigade, they all rode up on an eminence
                            where they had a good view of the enemy's lines.
                            Here in our front the enemy had a battery of steel
                            guns, not more than four hundred <note>

                            </note> soon as the Generals reached the summit of
                            the hill, they were observed by the enemy, and were
                            fired on from this steel battery, and they all fell
                            back. Gen Polk not being satisfied with the view he
                            had, rode back to the same point and stood but a
                            moment, yet one moment too long.</p>
                        <p>A second shot, well aimed from the same battery sent
                            a four pound shot through his body, killing him
                            instantly.</p>
                        <p>In this sad calamity we sustained a loss not to be
                            easily filled. Gen Polk was a brave officer a good
                            man, a christian soldier.</p>

                            dislodge him. On the 24th they made an attack on

                            left to right, the music of battle rang and our men
                            sent volley after volley into the ranks of the
                            advancing foe.</p>

                            and the roar of musketry was so continuous we could

                            judgment. In Walker's division, was clearly shown

                        <p>Many of the enemy's dead lay on the ground until the

                            of the sun, no one on either side dare venture over
                            the head logs. A truce covering Cheatham's division
                            was agreed upon to bury the dead, to last one hour.
                            During that hour the ground between the two lines
                            was thronged with the "Blue &amp; Gray" who met as
                            friend meets friend. To them the hour expired
                            seemingly in a moment. At one point on this line,

                        <p>It was dangerous to get up on top of the ground after
                            dark and certain death to do so in day time.</p>

                            days the fighting had been one continuous battle.
                            The country all around was cut up with entrenchments
                            and honey combed with rifle pits and the woods
                            looked almost as dreary and as desolate as if it had
                            been swept by repeated tornadoes. After all, the

                            Hope, and Kennesaw, the Old 19th Tennessee lost many
                            of her noble and brave men. Two of whom we make
                            mention of because we had more to do with them after
                            their death.</p>
                        <p>John White of Co "E" was one. He was an educated and
                            polished young man, and related to the best families
                            of <name type="place">Knoxville</name>. On this
                            Kennesaw line he was almost torne to pieces with a
                            shell. When they reached us with him which was in a
                            very few <orig resp="nl">minits</orig> after he was
                            hit, we shall never forget the expression of anguish
                            and despair that rested upon his sad pale face. He
                            talked but little, but that little was an
                            exhortation to those around him, not to live as he
                            had. The last audible word he ever uttered were
                            "Boys dont live as I have, remember my fate" John
                            had been very wicked. He lived but an hour. He was
                            carried back out of range of shot, on the road where
                            were several dead, and where we alone lay with the
                            dead to guard them until morning.</p>
                        <p>We took out of his bowels a piece of shell which had
                            imbeded its self weighing about two pounds.</p>
                        <p>The other one was John Spears of Co "K" who was also
                            killed on this line. Spears one morning was going
                            after water for the men on the line. He had fifteen
                            or twenty canteens across his shoulder, and was
                            going down an incline to a branch.</p>

                            logs on the line, was one of the kind the boys say
                            has a shuck tied to it, passed on over struck
                            Spears, tore about half the top of his head off.</p>
                        <p>He had an Aunt living in Marietta. We were detailed
                            to carry him to his Aunt and see he was burried. We
                            found his Aunt about noon. It was a sad meeting. But
                            in the sorrow that so heavely pressed upon her
                            heart, she did not forget us, but urged that we go
                            home with her and take dinner.</p>
                        <p>We could not refuse, and persuasion was not needed.
                            Nearly two long years had gone by since we had eaten
                            in a home or at a table. We were sorry for her, poor
                            sad, but kind hearted woman, for sitting down to the
                            table she could not eat. But we were to busily
                            engaged in just then to think of the dead</p>
                        <p>There were thousands of dead left on the blood
                            stained fields of theirs Kennesaw region to sleep
                            through the ages, whom the loud cannon's roar cannot

                        <p>At Smyrna<lb/>the next morning the enemy supposing
                            there was no one in their front were more bold.
                            Stanly came up, and pressed vigorously forward as if
                            no one was there to challenge. But a surprise
                            awaited him, He soon found his division in a perfect
                            hornet's nest. The sheet of lead that came from the
                            hidden lines of the Confederates in the edge of the
                            woods, and grape and canister from several
                            batteries, caused them to return in hot hast across
                            the field over which they had just come. They left a
                            few of their number lying on the field dead a
                            wounded, not taking time to look after them.</p>

                            he crossed the Chattahooche river, where he formed
                            his lines close along the river, where we remained
                            for several days.</p>

                            moved the greater part of his Army to our right, and
                            up the river where he too crossed at different
                            points. Schofield crossed, seven miles above the
                            railroad at Phillip's ferry at the mouth of Soap
                            Creek, McPherson crossed seven or eight miles still
                            further up, at Roswell's ferry.</p>

                            river, it was the dividing line between the Armies.
                            Our videtts and those of the enemy sat upon opposite
                            banks of the Chattahooche and chatted with each

                            each other's post, while some would keep a lookout
                            for the officers of each Army. Each one had been
                            fighting so long on the picket line they were glad
                            for a change and for a time when they could hold a

                            </choice>. This whas a death knell of the Army of
                            Tennessee. Was not the finger of God in this? We
                            will see. With bowed heads and sorrowful hearts the
                            Army of Tennessee yielded to the decree of Fate. We
                            were surprised and the news of the change came to
                            the men like a clap of thunder from a clear sky. We
                            are sorry we can not give the names of all our
                            regiment who were killed and wouned since we left
                            Adairsville.</p>

                        <p>Gen. J.B. Hood was now in command of the Army of
                            Tennessee. With all due respect to Gen Hood, whom we
                            do not censure, we must say this was a stab to the
                            Confederacy, as well as to the Army of Tennessee,
                            through which wound ultimately poured the life blood

                            Before he was a ware of danger, he ran upon a column
                            of Cheatham's division, headed by our brigade in
                            line of battle in a skit of woods right in his rear.
                            The brigade was Maney's and commanded by the Col of
                            the 19th Tenn in which was our regiment. McPherson
                            rode up close to us before he observed we were
                            Confederate, and perhaps not before he was halted
                            and surrender. But acting upon the first impulse of
                            the moment, he turned to escape, when a volly from

                            was fired Gen McPherson fell from his horse killed,
                            one or two of his staff wounded &amp; captured, only
                            one made his escape. Cheatham's division pressed
                            forward to their works, and into the hottest of the
                            fight, breaking Logan's line &amp; capturing two or
                            three pieces of Artill, and two hundred men. The
                            enemy's line of works at this place formed an obtuce
                            angle, the point of which our regiment approached.

                            works. And in thes charge Col. F.M. Walker fell,
                            &amp; where the brave &amp; faithful soldier John
                            Templeton of Co A = also fell =. Templeton was
                            always at roll call when not sick or on duty. This
                            was a desperate charge. The enemy were driven back,
                            but soon made a charge on us, in which they
                            recaptured the guns we had taken. In this second

                            were mortally wounded, Tom Dintt, and John Long were

                            fight.</p>
                        <p>There had not been much harder fighting anywhere,
                            than was done in this battle.</p>

                        <p>Gen Hardee lost heavely, but the enemy certainly must
                            have been much more. The enemy's loss in killed,
                            wounded &amp; captured was about four or five
                            thousand. Our brigade lost one hundred &amp; <del
                                rend="strikethrough">fifty</del> forty. The old
                            19th Tenn had her share of casualties as usual. Our
                            field hospital was back on the ridge near Cobb's
                            Mills - just a short distance in rear of the battle
                            field.</p>
                        <p>When Hardee returned to the city, &amp; to his
                            position around the works, a detail was made to
                            remain in the hospital with the wounded of whom were
                            more Federals than Confederates. From this field
                            hospital, looking across the Federal lines, we could
                            see the Spires &amp; the smoke of the city, which
                            could not have been more than four miles <del
                                rend="strikethrough">was</del> away. The writer
                            was one of the detail to remain in the field
                            hospital &amp; of course would be captured as the
                            Federals were all around us. There were a few of our
                            regiment left, wounded so badly could not be taken
                            away. While we did not relish the idea of being a
                                <orig resp="nl">prisner</orig>, duty to our boys
                            &amp; obedience to orders, we stayed willingly.</p>
                        <p>Capt Paul McDemott &amp; Sergeant Richards died and
                            we helped bury them, one on the hill side, the other
                            near the creek, a hundred yards or more below the
                            mills. All of our regiment who were left here
                            died.</p>

                        <p>Col Walker, Capt McDemott and Sergt Richards were
                            members of the Presbyterian Church. Col Walker was a
                            brave and noble man. To love him was but to know
                            him. We never saw him do anything unbecoming a
                            christian, nor did we ever <note>

                            spoken in the presence of Ladies. We were with him
                            all the time, on the march and our tent pitched near
                            his in camp.</p>
                        <p>Capt McDermott was a stern but not overbearing man.
                            He hated any one who shirked duty, and admired
                            bravery and fortitude where ever found. On every
                            battlefield were found those who <orig resp="nl"
                                >stired</orig> our sympathies to the very
                            bottom, both of our friends and among our foes. Here
                            we found a Federal boy not more than sixteen years
                            old. He had both eyes shot out, and was wounded in
                            the body and one leg. He was brought back with our
                            wounded, and had been put out on the ground in the
                            shade, to await his turn for <orig resp="nl"
                                >surgecal</orig> attention. In moving around we
                            ran upon this young man lying out in the hot sun. We
                            did what we could, placed him in the shade again
                            gave him water, and made him as comfortable as the
                            surrounding would admit. We found in our
                            conversation <note>

                            than he had expected. With a trembling voice his
                            heart bleeding with sorrow, he told me he wished he

                            an Illinois regiment. Poor boy he had our
                            sympathies. Oh! the lonely, anxious waiting of sad
                            mothers for their sons of both Armies who never
                            would return. We remained here four or five days,
                            the Federal line was but a short distance from us,
                            and directly between us and our command. After we
                            had burried all of our regiment who were left here,
                            we wanted to return to the regiment. We asked
                            permission of our surgeon Dr. Dulaney.</p>
                        <p>He had no objections, if we were willing to risk
                            being killed or captured which would be quite
                            different if we remained. We took the risk, flanking
                            both the Federal and our own lines. We reached the
                            city and our regiment safely.</p>

                            the ditches, fighting more or less every day until
                            the latter part of August.</p>
                        <p>The writer frequently had to go into the city and to
                            the Depot. We were at the Depot one morning when the
                            Federals shelled the city with great fury.</p>
                        <p>It seemed <note>

                            several buildings were fired, One large brick filled
                            with cotton on Peach tree street was set on fire by
                            a shell exploding inside the building, it burned for
                            weeks.</p>
                        <p>In the vicinity of the Depot the shells fell fast and
                            thick, killing and wounding a good many. There were
                            two brick depots, with a space between them of some
                            fifteen feet. We wer standing on the platform,
                            looking at some men carrying a wounded man away, who
                            had just been hit with a piece of shell, when a
                            shell burst a few feet over our heads, the pieces
                            falling all around me, two or three of which struck
                            the floor within an inch or two of my feet. You need
                            not try to hide, brick walls were penetrated and
                            knocked down, so one place was as safe as an
                            other.</p>

                        <p>After the battle of 22d July Gen Cheatham came back
                            to his old division and Gen SD Lee took command of
                            Hood's Old Corps. The Tennesseeans were glad to get
                            their old command again, and Gen Cheatham was
                            equally glad. There was an affection between him and
                            his men that was sweet to enjoy.</p>

                        <p>Gen <name type="person">Sherman</name> had now nearly
                            encircled <name type="place">Atlanta</name>. He had
                            sent the 16th and 17th Army Corps under Dodge and
                            Blair respectively around west of the city to "Ezra
                            Church." Hood sent Lee to attack there and if
                            nothing more to hold them, from joining Logan's and
                            Ransom's Corps, whom Hardee had gone to attack near
                            Jonesboro. Lee on the 28 August attacked Logan at
                            Ezra Church, but failing to drive him back fell back <note>

                            </note> and joined Hardee at Jonesboro. Here Hardee
                            at 3.30 in the evening of September 1st attacked
                            Logan's and Ransom's Corps. The fight was stubborn,
                            and heavy, lasting until after dark, when seemingly
                            by mutual consent the two armies began to retire,
                            and moved in the same direction and almost on the
                            same road. We moved about two miles and went into
                            camp, the two armies it might be said <note>

                        <p>A strange scene.</p>
                        <p>It was after dark when the writer left the
                            battlefield, we were on the field with the litter
                            corps, but when the regiment began moving from the
                            scene of action, we moved off with it, and left the
                            others of the litter or surgeon's corps behind.
                            Halting about two miles from the battle field, the
                            entire Corps of Hardee went into bivouac.</p>
                        <p>The whole country was full of soldiers, and soon
                            fires began to kindle up, and the Confederates did
                            not have half the fires that were made.</p>

                            after the regiment had moved, had quite an
                            experience in finding our regiment. The first

                            lying down, with but very few fires visible
                            anywhere. The Dr. inquired whose regiment <note>

                            in the direction from which he came. Some of the Old

                        <p>About midnight Gen Hardee rode into one camp and

                            see whose command it was: he went over there but did
                            not return; and General Hardee knew they were the
                            enemy and Arthur was captured. The camp fires
                            revealed the true situation. The Federals had us
                            surrounded like a horseshoe - with a gap of only
                            four hundred yards and through this opening about
                            two oclock <note>

                            </note> Gen Hardee moved his command with as much
                            silence as ever men moved. We slipped out from the
                            grasp of the enemy so silently that they did not
                            know we were gone till daylight. So Arthur saved
                            Hardee. This was the last battle of the campaign,
                            and while Hardee was fighting here at Jonesboro;
                            Hood was hurrying every thing away from <name
                                type="place">Atlanta</name>. He hurried away to
                            join Hardee &amp; Lee below Jonesborow, at Lovejoy
                            Station. Here we remained several days, not far from
                            our last battle ground. We lost out of our old
                            regiment several killed and wounded.</p>
                        <p>We mourn the many battle <orig resp="nl"

                            was heard. There was a feeling of sweet rest, for

                            battle.</p>
                        <p>All the regiments were so reduced by the ravages of
                            war that they were but mere skeletons, and in order
                            to make them more respectable, there was ordered a
                            consolidation of regiments. There were now in our
                            regiment three regiments, the 19th, 24th and
                            41st.</p>
                        <p>So it ran through out the whole army, yet neither
                            regiment lost its identity or individuality.</p>
                        <p>In the new arrangement, our regiment was commanded by
                            Col. James D. Tilman, keeping its place in Strah's
                            brigade. On the 19th September the Army left
                            Jonesboro and moved to Palmetta on the <name

                            quiet rest. - a much needed rest.</p>

                        <p>The young Confederacy had evidently reached a crisis
                            in its struggle for existence. The clouds that had
                            been gathering to obscure the future prospects of
                            the Confederacy were becoming more dark and
                            pretentious. At this juncture of affairs President
                            Davis, Howell E Cobb and others, paid the Army of
                            Tennessee a visit. Something had to be done. And to
                            infuse new life and vigour into the men speeches
                            were made by the President, Cobb and others. While
                            Cobb was speaking, pouring his sweet sounding words
                            in our ears, a private remarked that a shell or two
                            would knock all the sweetness out in less than no
                            time. The hopes of success, in the minds of the
                            soldier had began to fade and grow dim.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Soon after the departure of Davis, Gen Hardee
                            resigned his place in the Army of Tennessee and took
                            command else where. Rumors were rife in camp as to
                            what was coming next. Some said Hardee resigned
                            because Hood was in command of the Army. Hurried<del

                        <p>September the 28th the Army was again put in motion,
                            and our faces this time were turned toward
                            Tennessee, but when we would reach the goal of our
                            anxious hearts was hidden in the womb of the future.
                            On our way we passed to the left of <name
                                type="place">Atlanta</name>, and not far from
                            Kennesaw Mountain, which stood with towering head,
                            keeping lone vigil over the thousands slain in
                            battle at its feet. The record of the battle fought
                            here will be handed down to coming ages, and will
                            mark an epoch in the history of this now famous
                            Mountain. As we gazed sadly from a distance it
                            seemed as if we still saw lingering the smoke of
                            battle and the scene of strife was again vivid in
                            memory. On the 9th of October we passed through
                            Cedar town, the enemy being in Rome, we flanked that

                            top of the eastern hill, the Federals had thrown up
                            a fort, garrisoned with negro troops and four brass
                            pieces which looked viciously on all around. We soon
                            took them in and all they had. The Federals also had
                            a block house up in Gap at Rocky face with a small
                            garrison.</p>
                        <p>Gen Bate moved up on them, demanded a surrender but

                            it was a hurriedly passing scout, the demmand was
                            indignantly refused. But when Bates division came in
                            sight, and he had turned a battery on them, and
                            began knocking down their fortress they quickly gave
                            in. We remained here but two days and nights.
                            Leaving <name type="place">Dalton</name>, we passed
                            through Mill Creek gap and turned westward, for
                            Lafayette. We passed on through this place, making

                        <p>After a march of seventy five miles we reached
                            Decatur on the 17th. Here we found a garrison of Ten
                            thousand Federals well fortified, with a strong fort
                            commanding every approach to the town.</p>
                        <p>We did not attempt and attack on the place, we could
                            not have taken it without considerable loss of men
                            and delay of time, which just now seemed to be of
                            more value than men, and more if we had taken it,
                            without the loss of a single man it would have been
                            of no importance to the Army. We remained here
                            however two days and nights, with <orig resp="nl"

                        <p>Our division was encamped in an open field of nearly
                            a mile in extent, out in front of the fort near a
                            small Grave yard or <orig resp="nl">cemetry</orig>.
                            During the evening of the second day we (the writer)
                            went out to our vidette post. The rifle pits were
                            just large enough for three men. The fort stood on
                            an elevation, over looking us with an open field
                            between us, and not knowing seemingly more than four
                            hundred yards away. Now and then a <note>

                            about thirty or fifty yards away, there came a shot
                            from the fort to hurry us up. It struck the ground a

                            us about ten feet to the right and went on bounding
                            to the woods. It was evidently fired at us.</p>

                        <p>Here Gen Hood expected to find ample supplies for the
                            campaign into Tennessee, the pontoons across the
                            river ready, every thing complete so he could hurry
                            on without delay. But no supplies were there and no
                            visible <orig resp="nl">sigins</orig> of any coming.
                            Gen Beauregard ad this in hand. had promised all
                            necessary supplies, but had utterly failed. This
                            failure was certainly against Hood and the Army of
                            Tennessee.</p>
                        <p>While we were tired and willing to rest, we were more

                            thing was not ready and waiting for Hood. After days
                            of anxious if not painful waiting, on Sunday morning
                            Nov 15th we looked out and saw a pontoon spanning
                            the river at the foot ot the mussel shoals. We moved
                            out the morning of the 15th with banners flying and
                            bands playing and crossed the river with a

                        <p>We started out from Florence early in the morning of
                            Nov 21st This was one of the coldest days of the
                            winter. It rained, sleeted and snowed. The wind blew
                            almost a hurricane in our faces, and with the snow,
                            was almost blinding. All day we ploded through the
                            blast, so slowly we could hardly keep warm. Late in
                            the evening we halted for the night, passing it
                            without rest or comfort to our weary bodies. We had
                            gone only about 12 miles.</p>
                        <p>The second morning the storm and cold had grown in
                            intensity, the wind was blowing a blizzard but on we
                            went. The second night we went into camp eighteen
                            miles from the night before and filed into the woods
                            after dark. The snow and ice covered everything, for
                            it had <note>

                            </note> snowing, sleeting and freezing all day long.
                            Soon trees began to fall from the hurried use of the
                            ax, and being after dark, the men could not be on
                            the lookout for falling trees. They came crashing
                            down here and there among them. We learned one man
                            was killed and others hurt <del rend="strikethrough"

                            about 30,000. They were entrenched on the south bank

                        <p>All of Hood's men did not get up the first evening,
                            and most of his Artillery was behind. The enemy
                            would have crossed to the north side of the river
                            that night but it was so strong neither army could
                            or did any maneuvering what ever. Hood did not
                            attack the enemy here. At the gray dawn of next
                            morning the 29th, the head of Cheatham's column
                            accompanied by Gen Hood himself could have been seen
                            crossing the river, six miles above <name
                                type="place">Columbia</name>, with Cleburne's
                            division in front. From this place to Spring Hill
                            there were two roads parallel and not more than half
                            mile apart. The enemy as early as we pushed out on
                            the main pike. We had to take an old and partly
                            abandoned dirt road.</p>
                        <p>We double quicked a good part of the way to Spring
                            Hill. Gen Forrest who had beaten us to Spring Hill
                            had entered the town, but was being driven back by
                            Wagner's and Kimball's divisions of the enemy, who
                            had preceeded Forrest but a very short time, when we
                            arrived.</p>
                        <p>Cleburne's division was the first infantry to engage
                            the enemy and as Brown's division to which the Old
                            19th belonged <note>

                                30th</date> we moved out for Franklin. Stewart's
                            Corps moved in the following order, Brown's
                            division, Cleburne and Bate's divisions, then came
                            Johnson's division of Lee's Corps. The other
                            divisions of Lee's were behind. About one oclock
                            that evening we reached the Winstead hills, a ridge
                            crossing the <name type="place">Columbia</name> pike
                            at right angles, about one and a half miles out from
                            Franklin. From these hills to the town was an open
                            plain, with nothing to obscure the vision, save here
                            and there small clusters of shrubberry. The ground
                            is a little undulating, but a gradual incline up to
                            the works of the enemy. Out in front of the enemy
                            and about the center of our right wing had been a
                            Locust thicket, but <note>

                            Running through this plot of ground were hedge
                            fences.</p>
                        <p>The 23d Army Corps of the Federals under Schofield
                            held this part of their line from the river above
                            town to the point where the Center Creek pike
                            enters. Their right was held by the fourth Army
                            Corps under Kimball.</p>
                        <p>Schofield had thrown a heavy line of infantry
                            strongly entrenched out from their main

                            main fortifications stood on the highest elevations,
                            extending from behind the Carter house on past the
                                <unclear reason="illegible" resp="nl"

                            fortification literally bristled with cannon. The
                            enemy had a battery on the opposite side of the
                            river that not <note>

                            entire field. Now in the face of all this glittering
                            belt of bayonets and cannon waiting to be turned
                            loose upon us, Hood advanced without the least
                            faltering. In the back yard of the Carter house,
                            between it and the enemy's works stood a locust
                            thicket. Near the pik and between the dwelling and
                            works stoon and old one story house, and in the rear
                            of the dwelling was a brick smoke house. Across the
                            pike stood the Gin house some fifty yards from the
                            dwelling house.</p>
                        <p>The Harpeth river makes a horse shoe bend around the
                            town. There are three pikes going into Franklin, the
                            Lewisburg, <name type="place">Columbia</name>, and
                            Carter Creek pike. On the Winstead hills Hood halted
                            and formed his line, between the hills and the town
                            out in the open plain. Stewart formed on the right,
                            his right resting on the Lewisburg pike. Cheatham
                            formed on Cleburne's and Brown's divisions on the
                            left of the Columbia pike, while Bate moved further
                            to the left and formed line near the Carter Creek
                            pike. Often, upon the eve of battle, is observed in
                            the actions of brave men something never before
                            noticed.</p>

                            </note> While we were yet on the Winstead hills
                            resting and waiting for the orders, Our brigadier
                            general, Strahl rode off to himself, dismounted
                            spread his blanket on the ground &amp; reclined as
                            if worn out - having nothing to say to any one, save
                            as his orderlies receive and gave reports. No one
                            ever observed this in Gen Strahl before. We
                            understood afterwards that Gen Strahl remarked to
                            two other Generals that he would be killed in this
                            engagement.</p>
                        <p>As we moved from the top of the hills, Gen Strahl as
                            he rode by the Old 19th remarked in our hearing,
                            "Boys this will be short but desperate." These were
                            the last words we ever heard Gen Strahl utter.</p>
                        <p>The Battle</p>
                        <p>The command forward, march! was given. The men moved
                            off with little care seemingly as to the fate
                            awaiting them. What a grand and imposing sight the
                            Army presented this beautiful Autumn evening, with
                            the golden haze of an Indian Summer, with not a
                            cloud to obscure the sun as it <orig resp="nl"

                        <p>As the line advanced, Cleburne's division moved to
                            the right and crossed the Columbia pike. Strahl's
                            brigade of Brown's division kept on the left, and
                            colsed up with Cleburne's division &amp; rested on
                            the pike and running back around the Carter
                            house.</p>

                            from the front, but a deadly one from across the
                            pike.</p>
                        <p>Gordon was already captured, Gist was killed and

                            soon after. This "Carter house" was the house of
                            this Gen Carter, who was wounded and died in the
                            very threshold of his own home, while his wife and
                            children were in the basement of the house during
                            the battle.</p>
                        <p>The works here in front of us were so high the men
                            could not scale them. Gen Strahl helped one of the
                            Old 19th up on top of the works, when he was shot
                            fell over on the side of the enemy. Then an other
                            who was helped up when he too was shot, the General
                            holding on to him, pulled him back into our own

                        <p>Tomas Alexander of Athens Tenn, and of Co "H" said,
                            "Gen help me up," "No," replied Gen Strahl "I have
                            helped my last man up to be shot in my hands."</p>
                        <p>Soon after this Gen Strahl was killed, followed
                            quickly by all his staff, who fell one upon the
                            other. Not withstanding Cleburne's and French's
                            divisions had been repulsed, Strahl's Gist's
                            Carter's and Gordon's bregades held the ground they
                            had gained with both their flanks exposed and
                            especially Strahl's from the cross fire between them
                            and the gin house.</p>
                        <p>Bates' division on our left had not been idle. He
                            assaulted the works exposed to a heavey fire both of

                            havoc with our men. In this charge Gen Granberry was
                            killed and his brigade was drived back with
                            considerable loss. Sear's and Cockrell's brigades

                            which Featherston, Scott, and Adams received a

                        <p>The Old 19th Tenn<lb/>certainly went through the
                            furnace to day. She withstood not only a most

                            enfilading one from the right, and but a few yard
                            away. During the battle Lieut Frank H. Hale of Co
                            "H" succeeded in scaling the works and crawled about
                            twenty feet in side the Federals lines to the framed

                            regiment. Sergeant Lem Walker of Co "E" also crossed
                            the works and took shelter behind the brick smoke
                            house, just in the rear of the dwelling were he was

                                rejoined the regiment. Zach Smith of Co A fired
                                from the top of the breast works repeatedly. And
                                Gen Strahl said to him, Zach my brave fellow I
                                will not forget you for this. But our beloved

                                just before reaching the works, pierced by

                        <p>Forrest with Chalmer's brigade of cavalry moved on
                            the Hillsboro pike, and Buford with Jackson's
                            brigade of Cavalry on the Wilson pike. These engaged
                            the enemy at Brentwood, but the Federals fell back
                            when Lee's Corps came up and camped for the night.
                            Stewart's Corps followed next.</p>
                        <p>Cheatham's Corps remained in Franklin until Dec the
                            2d when he moved on for Nashville. Hood formed his
                            lines around Nashville almost parallel with those of
                            the enemy the evening of the 3d. On this line
                            Cheatham occupied the extreme right, covering the
                            line between the Nashville and <name type="place"
                                >Chattanooga</name> railroad and the Nolensville

                            the Franklin Pike.</p>
                        <p>Stewart's Corps joining Lee's left continued on and
                            across the Granny White pike. The evening of the 3d
                            Hood ordered Bate's division of Cheatham's Corps to
                            Murfreesboro, leaving Cheatham with only two
                            divisions, when he took position on the line around
                            Nashville.</p>
                        <p>(Hood was criticized for this move on to Nashville,
                            and many thought he had not reasoned wisely, and

                            soldier is not to criticize but obey. After a few
                            days hovering around scanty fires, and gazing upon
                            the capitol building from the red hills east of the
                            city, Gen Hood ordered Bate's division from
                            Murfreesboro to take its place in line with
                            Cheatham. The return of Bate's division into line
                            extended Stewart's line to and beyond the Hillsboro
                            pike, and almost to Hardin pike.</p>
                        <p>From our position we could plainly see the Captial
                            and the guns that stood sentinel in the eastern
                            yard. The morning of December the 8th rolled around
                            bringing one of the coldest days we had experienced
                            for a long time. There were sleet, and snow, and ice
                            and rain, and the driving wind rendered it the more
                            uncomfortable.</p>
                        <p>We were out in the open fields, on an elevation
                            without protection from the wintery blasts. We were
                            thinly clad, many of us with out shoes, with nothing
                            what ever to keep our sore and bleeding feet from
                            the cold and frozen ground. (The writer was one of
                            these) We were without tents, and with but one old
                            worn blanket to each man with which to cover at
                            night. Our only bed was the frozen ground, and that
                            covered with ice and snow. For days we stood
                            watching the enemy in this uncomfortable plight.</p>
                        <p>Ambition, and even life its self were almost frozen
                            out of us. In the midst of all this we gazed
                            defiantly at the enemy in his comfortable quarters,
                            and at the frowning cannons on forts Negley, Casim

                            had some what subsided, when the morning of December
                            the 15th dawned, bringing with it a dense fog that
                            rested on the hill tops and covered all the plains.
                            Thomas in the early morning under cover of this fog,
                            moved his men and formed his lines before Hood knew
                            he was so closely threatened. By 9 Oclock the sun
                            had melted away the almost frozen fog, and the enemy
                            under Gen Steadman with a division of Negro troops,
                            was seen moving on Cheatham, who occupied the right
                            of our line, not far from the Rains house.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time Thomas had concentrated his forces
                            on our left, and was waiting for the fog to blow
                            away. The negro troops in front of Cheatham came up
                            boldly in the charge, but at the first well directed
                            fire of our men, seeing many of their number fall
                            they turned to fly, but were by the second line of
                            their own men who with bayonets forced them to renew
                            the attack, with but a repetition of their former
                            effort. Steadman charged time and time again, but
                            was repulsed each time with severe loss. Cheatham
                            was not moved.</p>
                        <p>On Hood's left and behind Ecton's brigade was
                            Chalmer's division of Cavalry, with Rucker's brigade
                            of Cavalry near the river. There was some cavalry on
                            the right of Ector. Walthall's division had been
                            withdrawn from Stewart's extreme left and put into
                            position in the rear of French's division, <pb

                            untill he reached the extreme left of Walthall. As
                            he fell back the 16th Army Corps rushed upon
                            Chalmers and swept him away like chalf before the

                            one hundred men. Still pressing forward, Stewart not
                            being able to check them, they captured an other

                            forced Walthrall around until his line was at right
                            angle to the one he occupied in the morning.
                            Walthall was now behind a Stone fence on the east
                            side of the Hillsboro pike. Hood ordered Johnson's
                            division of Lee's Corps to reinforce Stewart at this
                            point, but before Johnson arrived the enemy had
                            driven this part of Stewart's left from its
                            position, and through the skirt of woods between the
                            Hillsboro and Granny White pikes.</p>
                        <p>On the arrival of Johnson the enemy were driven back
                            and Stewart reoccupied the woods, but only for a
                            short time. The enemy reinforced and drove our men
                            back and not only through the woods, but beyond <pb

                            rear of Walthall and Loring. In this last charge
                            through the wood, Gen Sears lost his right leg by a
                            shot from one of Kimble guns, and was captured. The

                            been altogether idle, but the center of attraction
                            was on our left. As soon as the enemy crossed the
                            Granny White <note>

                            his advance and checked him. This put an end to the
                            days fighting and darkness coming on, the two Armies
                            settled down for the night.</p>
                        <p>During the day, Hood was driven back about two and a
                            half miles. The weather was very cold and the ground
                            frozen. The sharp points of frozen mud rendered it
                            difficult, and even painful for Hood's brave
                            farefooted men to maneuver. Why Thomas did not
                            capture Hood's whole army seemed strange to us. Hood
                            had lost nearly all his artillery, but comparatively
                            few <note>

                            between the <orig resp="nl">the</orig> two pikes and

                        <p>Cheatham's line ran up to the summit of a high point
                            called Shy's hill and turned south at right angles

                            confronted Schofield's and part of Wilson's Corps.
                            Our men threw up breast works as best they could,
                            having no tools with which to work, and the ground
                            being frozen.</p>

                        <p>Steadman with his Negro brigades Post's and
                            Straight's divisions confronted Lee this time.
                            Post's division and Thompson's Negro <orig resp="nl"
                                >trops</orig> were in front of Clayton's
                            division and Pettus' brigade of Stevenson's
                            division. During all the early morning Thomas kept
                            shelling Hood's line to find just how it ran. Maj
                            Frereheart had two guns he succeeded in bringing off
                            the field the day before, and planted them on a hill
                            or knoll in the rear of Bate's division. Thomas had
                            part of Smith's Corps in front of Cheatham, while
                            Schofield extended far beyond Cheatham's left with
                            Wilson's cavalry far around on our left flank.</p>
                        <p>Thomas opened fire on Hoods left, all along on his
                            left wing about 8 or 9 oclock in the morning of the
                            1th. The artillery fire was heavy and lasted for an
                            hour or more. The infantry began moving against us,
                            then coming in solid columns and made repeated
                            charges but repulsed with loss. Thomas kept moving
                            to our left &amp; reinforcing his right. About noon
                            they had gained the hills commanding the Granny
                            White Pike, and drove Cheatham from his position. As
                            Strahl's brigade descended and entered the corn
                            field at the base of the high knoll, they had to
                            cross the cross fire of the enemy's artillery and
                            from the small arms made it uncomfortably heavy.</p>

                        <p>This knoll occupied by the Old 19th was a salient in
                            Hood's line, forming a right angle on this hill, and
                            as the Federals pressed in on the two sides, they
                            crowded us as we passed through the field. The
                            ground had thawed during the day just enough to be
                            sticky and cling to our feet, so <note>

                            </note> we could hardly get along, and being in an
                            exceedingly great hurry we thought we would never
                            reach the woods beyond.</p>
                        <p>As we crossed this field Federals and <orig resp="nl"
                                >Rebles</orig> were running together. Several of
                            our regiment were captured in this field. Our Color
                            bearer John Mason came very near loosing our colors.
                            A Federal caught at the flag several times, but
                            Mason tore them from the staff, and stuffed them in
                            his bosom and ran on and out safely. Thus far in all
                            our battles the colors of the Old 19th had escaped
                            capture. Tattered and torn by the bullets of many a
                            fray, it had survived them all and still was in the
                            hands of its old regiment to lead us where ever it
                            should go.</p>
                        <p>As we fell back, Hood's whole left wing swung round,
                            and the enemy captured Generals Jackson and Smith an
                            Turner's battery, Gen Govan was wounded.</p>
                        <p>As the regiment was going through the cornfield James
                            Havely came near being captured. He had almost given
                            out, his feet <note>
                                <add place="above">were</add>

                            discovered an opening made by a shell through which
                            he went, and getting on to firm ground made his
                            escape.</p>

                        <p>Lee on the right held his own, although there were
                            repeated assaults by Post's and Streight's brigades,
                            who were repulsed with a loss of two or three

                        <p>Thompson's Negro brigade came against Clayton ant
                            Pettus like a black cloud rolling up the horizon
                            charging as if they would tear every thing before
                            them. They came up under fire but a short distance
                            and returned in double quick time leaving between
                            four and five hundred on the field when the left
                            wing gave way, Lee fell back, and formed again, and
                            the Army bivouaced within two miles of where our
                            line was in the morning. While the Army, especially
                            the left wing fell back in some confusion through
                            the Brentwood hills, they regained their composure
                            and camped in perfect quiet and order within two
                            miles of where they camped the night before.</p>

                            the Tennessee River. Holtsclaw's brigade brought up

                            cavalry. The roads were very mudy and all of the

                            captured before they could reach the crossing <note
                                place="margin">When the head of Cheatham's
                                command reached the pontoons a cross Duck river,
                                it met Forest Cavalry. The time for Forrest to
                                cross had arrived but Cheatham had been so hotly
                                engaged with the enemy, that he failed to cross
                                at his appointed hour. Forrest insisted on his
                                right to cross, Cheatham on his. Hot words
                                ensued; and all along the line of the Old 19th
                                the cocking of guns was heard and the whispered
                                threat if he touches Old Frank we will shoot him
                                &amp; his whole command. But this state of
                                things was only for a moment. Forrest gave way
                                &amp; Cheatham crossed before Forrest.</note>
                            Thomas was certainly pressing our rear for all it
                            was worth, with the 4th and 16th Army Corps and
                            Wilson's Cavalry. The safty of Hood's Army lay
                            almost wholy in a substantial rear guard and to this

                        <p>Gen Hood told Gen Walthall that this rear guard was a
                            place of honor, and very great responsibility and
                            peril and that he would not impose it upon him with
                            out his consent. And told him to pick out of the
                            Army such regiments as he thought he could rely
                            upon.</p>
                        <p>Hood said the Army must be saved if that detachment
                            was sacrificed to accomplish it. Gen Walthall
                            replied that he had never asked for a hard place for
                            glory, nor for an easy one for comfort, but would
                            take his chances for weal or woe.</p>
                        <p>Gen Walthall selected the brigades of Featherston,
                            Palmer, Sthral, Quarles, Ector, Reynolds, Maney and
                            Smith for this special guard. He felt that he could

                        <p>From this point, Walthrall fell back to Richland

                            and part of Chalmers brigades of cavalry, and their
                            flank movement was checked, but not without
                            considerable fighting, in which engagement Gen
                            Bufford was wounded.</p>
                        <p>Gen Forrest, at this time; was with Walthrall on the
                            Creek, when a Courier came dashing up, (and it was
                            difficult to tell which was the nearest out of wind
                            the horse or rider,) to Gen Forrest and said,
                            "General the enemy are now in our rear." To which
                            the Gen replied, "Well ding it, aint we in

                            position in the works that had hastenly been thrown

                            the 25 we fell back again, leaving Jackson's Cavalry
                            to hold the place as long as he could, and on his
                            retiring burn the bridge. Soon after leaving <name

                            pike and encountered roads almost impassible. The
                            rains, the freezing and thawing made the ground so
                            soft that our Artillery and ordinance wagons moved
                            slowly and with great difficulty. X <note

                            and with vigor. Although the main body of the army

                        <p>Early in the morning of the 25th Gen Forrest ordered
                            Walthrall to form on <lb/> Anthony's Hill <lb/>which
                            was about five or six miles from <name type="place"
                                >Pulaski</name> and hold the enemy in check
                            until our wagon train could get beyond their reach
                            and well on towards the river. The ground on
                            Anthony's hill was so broken and the woods so dense
                            that a small body of men could be easily hidden.
                            Walthrall formed his men so they were completely
                            concealed, with a brigade of cavalry on the right
                            and one on the left flank, and sent out a skirmish
                            line in front. This skirmish line the enemy attacked
                            vigerously and drove them in following close upon
                            them, little dreaming there was a line lying in wait
                            for time.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the enemy reached Walthrall's line he
                            opened fire upon them from his hidden place with his
                            infantry and one battery which also was concealed;
                            pouring into them such an effective fire they could
                            not stand and retired in confusion. Our men pushed
                            them closely capturing a number of <orig resp="nl"
                                >prisners</orig> and horses an two pieces of

                        <p>As dark came on Walthrall again fell back, marching
                            until midnight when he reached Sugar Creek and
                            camped for the remainder of the night <note>

                                This incident we call to mind of that nights
                                march. The old 19th had several times asked Col.
                                Heiskell to mount them &amp; join the cavalry.
                                As we approached Sugar Creek 11 oclock at night,
                                sleeting - raining and sloppy, the poor fellows
                                were silent &amp; all still save the splash of
                                their half shod feet in that December night's
                                slush. The silence darkness &amp; the gloom felt
                                oppressive. Col Heiskell called out "Boys how do
                                you like the cavalry"- Several replied- "Ah Col
                                this is not regular cavalry. And then some one
                                holloed out "I think this has been pretty d--d
                                regular for the last 48 months." So when we
                                reached Sugar Creek the foot cavalry waded it.
                                The ice cold water coming up under their arm

                        <p>It seemed that the nearer we came to the river the
                            more vigerously we were pressed by the enemy as if
                            they were determined on bagging their game before it
                            could escape. Again we ran upon our wagons, several
                            of which were loaded with ammunition.</p>
                        <p>Apart of the teams had been taken to assist in
                            hurrying up the pontoon wagons. Before the day of
                            the 26th the wagons were pushed on as rapidly as
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>Walthrall put Reynolds' and Field's brigades between
                            the two crossings of the creek. Palmer's and
                            Featherstone's brigade on the south side of the
                            crossings in a strong position. The "Old 19th" being
                            in Fields brigade was between the two crossings. The
                            fog this morning was so dense, you could discern an
                            object only a short distance from you, which enabled
                            our two brigades to conceal them selves.</p>
                        <p>They sent forward a small squad as pickets, a short
                            distance. Wilson's Cavalry was the vanguard of the
                            enemy and when they came upon our pickets they
                            dismounted and commenced skirmishing. The small
                            picket force fell back quickly to our main line, the
                            enemy come charging after them. But they ran<del

                            way of the enemy, our boys captured nearly all the
                            horses of one regiment, and a good many prisners.
                            Our Cavalry pursued them for some distance <note

                                Heiskell often said that this was the most

                                war. Here came the host of Federals flushed with
                                victory - in all the pomp and circumstances of
                                glorious war. There stood the battered, scarred
                                &amp; hungry worn remnants of eight brigades, no
                                one of which had over one hundred &amp; twenty
                                five men in it then; (Strahl's had only 112 men)
                                and yet when the command "charge" was given, as

                                with the rebel yell ringing loud above the din
                                of battle they swept the finely equipped Federal

                            and we moved and halted at our leisure. Resuming the
                            march we camped that night within twenty miles of

                                the bridge; to be followed by Fields and then
                                Palmer. Gen Reynolds will withdraw his command
                                from the Shoal Creek in time to reach the main
                                line by daylight, leaving a skirmish line behind
                                for half an hour. Ector's brigade will cover the
                                road until the whole command has passed, then he
                                will follow, leaving a skirmish line until the
                                rear of his brigade is on the bridge. Move with
                                promptness and in good order.</p>
                            <p>By command of Maj Gen Walthrall<lb/>E.D. Clark
                                Asst Adj. Gen.</p>

                        <p>So at 3 oclock in the morning of December 28th we
                            moved out from Shoal Creek, excepting Reynolds
                            brigade which remained as guard and picket until
                            nearly day light, when he moved out quickly.</p>
                        <p>Walthrall moved on with his other three divisions and
                            occupied the works covering the pontoon bridge</p>

                        <p>It was just forty three days from the time Hood
                            crossed the river at Florence with his jubilant army
                            on his way into Tennessee, until he recrossed at
                            Bainbridge with but a fragment of his former force.
                            The forty three days were sad ones to Hood and his
                            Army.</p>
                        <p>In them are crouded the disastrous battle of Franklin
                            and the utter defeat and rout of his Army at
                            Nashville.</p>
                        <p>As a result he lost one Maj. Gen killed, for Maj
                            Gens. wounded, vis= Cleburne killed, Brown, Johnson,
                            Lee, and Bufford wounded; and five Brigades killed,

                            were nine Brigades wounded vis Govan, Sears,
                            Jackson, Gordon, Deas, Cockrell, Duasels, Scott and
                            Managault. Of these Gens Johnson, Jackson, Deas,
                            Gordon, Smith &amp; Sears, were captured. <del

                        <p>He lost nearly one half of his regimental officers,
                            and about thirty (30) percent of his men. Nearly one
                            half of his ordinance trains, and nearly all of his

                            the men underwent in this campaign, and with what
                            fortitude they bore up under it all. There were many
                            phases in the Soldiers life in this campaign, amid
                            its hardships and toils and suffering that were
                            amusing, and the many cunning and adroit ways, no

                        <p>Clabe Perry of Co "E" with Lieut J. Waller leaving
                                <name type="place">Pulaski</name> one evening
                            straggled off the main road the army was on, and
                            traveled that evening to suit themselves.</p>
                        <p>As they were passing a log cabin, Clabe espied some
                            leaf tobacco hanging in the chimney corner. Going up
                            to the house they found no one there but an old
                            woman. During these times provisions, especially
                            Salt, Coffee and Sugar were very scarce, and who
                            were lucky enough to have these luxuries kept them
                            hid, and if they should be called for they were out
                            and had been for months, which was indeed the truth
                            in the majority of instances. The old Lady had one
                            son of ten summers, who had then gone to mill with a
                                <del rend="strikethrough">last</del> grist of
                            corn, and would be back soon. Clabe <orig resp="nl"
                                >purchast</orig> some of the tobacco, and then
                            inqueried for Sargum. She said she had some in the
                            smoke house. The Lieut and the Old Lady went around
                            into the Smokehouse for the Sargum, and Clabe
                            slipped into the house, and in his prowling found
                            the bed tick a small sack of salt and a pair of
                            yellow Jones pants, evidently belonged to the boy.
                            Putting these under his blanket, he hastened out to
                            where the old woman and the Lieutenant were
                            measuring Sargum. Clabe said "Madam we have no money
                            but will pay you for your Sargum in salt, as we have
                            more than we want to carry."</p>
                        <p>"La! Me" said the old woman, "That is just what I
                            want, I have not had any salt for weeks." So Clabe
                            paid the Old Woman for the sargum, with her own
                            salt.</p>
                        <p>They wanted meal, and inquired the way to the
                            mill.</p>
                        <p>
                            <del rend="strikethrough">So</del> they started out
                            with the expectation of meeting her son. Which they
                            did. Clebe wanted to buy some of the meal but the
                            boy refused, Clabe begged and finally told him <note>
                                <add place="above">that</add>
                            </note> he had a pair of pants sent him from home
                            that were too small which he would give him for a
                            little meal. They traded and when Clabe took out the
                            pants the boy said, "I have a pair at home just like
                            them," "So you may," said Clabe, "and two pairs wont
                            hurt you, as you see these are good ones." So Clabe
                            paid the boy for the meal with his own pants.</p>

                            Two of the boys and myself went further on about
                            half mile seeking shelter, for it was bitter cold.
                            We had plenty of raw bacon and crackers, and were
                            not hunting anythign to eat, only a shelter.</p>
                        <p>We came to a house where were but four persons, the
                            mother and three children the youngest perhaps four
                            years old. We asked for shelter for the night, she
                            granted our request. We found the Mother cooking lye
                            hominy, the only thing an all she had in the way of
                            provisions. The night was dark and gloomy &amp; the
                            bright light from the old fire place looked cheerful
                            to us; but it revealed the sorrowful expression on
                            the care worn face of the mother, as she prepared
                            the last morsel of food for her self and children,
                            not knowing whence the next would come, the hominy
                            was soon done, and <pb

                            were invited to eat with them but refused. We lay

                        <p>Hood after recrossing the river, moved on to Corinth
                            Miss. Here we rested a few days, and from here Hood
                            furloughed a great many of the men, those from
                            Middle Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississipi. Although
                            their furloughs were but for a few days, few of the
                            men ever returned to the army again. Our roll calls
                            were now soon over with, for these were only <note>

                            seemed but a Corporal's guard. From here we moved on
                            to Tupelo Miss, starting out as usual in a hard
                            pelting rain, and after a muddy tromp of three days
                            we reached Tupelo on the <date when="1865-01-13"
                                >13th day of January 1865</date>.</p>
                        <p>We expected to draw clothing at Corinth, but there
                            was none for us. Many without shoes - thin clothing
                            ragged and torn, pants hanging in threads at the
                            bottom. Some had only a piece of a coat, and the
                            crown of their hats all gone. The <orig resp="nl"
                                >barefotted</orig> had sore and bleeding feet,
                            and each foot was loth to follow the other as they
                            moved.</p>
                        <p>But amidst the ruin and wreck the years of toil and
                            battle had brought, the "Old 19th," what was left of
                            it, still had vitallity left to stand erect, and
                            when there were posts of danger to be filled, she
                            was always ready to respond, here am I send send me.
                            She possessed the true grit, the true type of
                            patriotism. The Old 19th Tennessee! We are proud of
                            her, proud of her record. Although with worn and
                            tattered uniform she walks wih a military step.</p>

                            mind. In fact the two soldiers were impressed with
                            the idea that the whole house was filled with an
                            atmosphere of composure and happiness that they had

                            reached this home, and that heaven had so marked it,
                            that the hand of the destroyer had passed it by, and
                            sought its victims in other homes. When bed time
                            came the two in uniform learned who their hosts
                            were. The elder of the two said to the other one,
                            "George you must act as high Priest to night." Then
                            Bishop Pierce took the bible and led in family
                            devotion. They wer at the home of Bishop Pierce and

                            bacon, and put them back well filled with ham,
                            biscuit, preserves and pickles. The next morning

                            the family, and on examining their haver sacks, were

                            that it was good to tarry, if but a night, with the
                            people of God.</p>

                            out two miles to a country residence to get some
                            washing done. We had only one shirt each, we had
                            that on it dirty. We had none to put on whiles these
                            were being washed. We went to the Negro Cabins in
                            the rear part of the yard, where three old negro
                            women were washing and said, "Aunty we want our
                            shirts washed and have no others to put on while
                            this is being done." "La bless you child" said Aunty
                            "dont care for that, jes pull em off and sit down we
                            will wash them and hurry too." During the
                            conversation with old Aunty, we found that same
                            feeling of trust and confidence existed here as at
                            home. They seemed as solicitous for their young
                            masters who were in the Confederate Army, and for
                            their return home as any member of the house hold,
                            for as they said we raised young master from baby
                            hood. They experienced fears of never seeing them
                            again. With them Slavery had not been abolished.
                            They knew no other home but this one, and loved no
                            other. To them it was their paridise, and their
                            surroundings were sacred to them. They were
                            happy.</p>

                        <p>In the days of slavery there were in almost every
                            family trusted servants who had been raised from
                            child hood to do special service in the house hold
                            of their masters, and between them and not only
                            their masters, but the entire household, especially
                            the white children, there existed a strong feeling
                            of natural affection. And there were in almost every
                            family those among the number of slaves whom the
                            childen called <lb/>Mammie<lb/> aged black women
                            into whose care and keeping were placed the
                            children. Their authority was almost equal to that
                            of the mother, and for them the children entertained
                            almost the tender love they did for their own
                            mother. to this black mammie the children carried
                            their grievances, into her ears their childish
                            stories told. And at any time when the children
                            wanted anything they knew to whom to go, for they
                            were never turned away empty.</p>
                        <p>And their childish hearts were often made glad <pb

                        <p>Many of the negro men were faithful during the war.
                            And when the war had ended were loth to give up the
                            home that had sheltered, fed and cared four them so
                            long, &amp; still remained and worked on, on the old
                            plantation. We knew some who after our Southern
                            homes were occupied by the Federal bayonets, where
                            the boys fom the Confederate Army slipped in home,
                            would hide them, care for them by carrying them

                            they returned to the Army. These were not merely
                            isolated cases, but a few among the thousands
                            through out the South.</p>

                            ourselves. But no excuse would she take, and coming
                            her self she said, "I see you have on no shirts, but

                            and at once appreciated our excuse. Of course she
                            reported to the rest of the family, and Mrs. Palmer
                            agreed to keep out all the young ladies. We had but

                            filed into the room and helped our plates, and then
                            sat down opposite to us and ate with us. The

                            together with that of the Mother soon wore off our

                            in the morning the Negros occupied the gallery, and
                            at night they held forth in the lower pues. The
                            concluded their services by singing, "I'm going home
                            to die no more," during which they were all in a

                            hands, and keeping time by the tramp of their feet.
                            While we were here the rain was almost continuous.
                            The streets, and especially around the depot were

                            officers as well as men anxious to be away. None
                            more than Gen Cheatham, who began to get into a
                            great bluster. One train had pulled out, an other <note>
                                <add place="above">was</add>
                            </note> ready with the troops on board the cars,
                                <del rend="strikethrough">which</del> was
                            standing on the track. Our brigade was waiting for
                            its train, but could not get on until this one was
                            out of the way. Gen Cheatham wanted this train to
                            move, and called out, "Where is the conductor for
                            this train?"</p>
                        <p>The conducture all dressed up in his dudish uniform
                            was standing in two or three steps of Gen Cheatham,
                            on the curbing and said "I am the conductor."</p>
                        <p>"Why dont you move out with your train, what are you
                            waiting on" said Cheatham. The conductor not knowing
                            who Cheatham was replied, "I am running that part of
                            the business sir." He had not more than finished his
                            remark when Cheatham let him feel the full weight of
                            his fist and landed him full length out in the mud.
                            It is needless to say the conductor was up and had
                            his train moving before he took time to shake of the
                            mud.</p>
                        <p>We pulled out late Saturday evening, and left the
                            cars at Smithfield late Sunday night. Monday morning
                            early we started for the front, and moved out twenty
                            miles, where we again began to hear the old familiar
                            sound of cannon, in the vicinity of <name

                        <p>We hurried on and early Tuesday evening we reached
                            the scene of action just in time to prevent the
                            coming of a column of the enemy through a gap in our
                            line of battle between the right and left wings of
                            the army.</p>
                        <p>Here our brigade and regiment had its first encounter
                            with the enemy on the new field, and since we had
                            crossed the Tennessee river on our return from
                            Nashville.</p>
                        <p>We drove them back, and completed the broken line.
                            Gen Hardee and part of Johnson's men had been hotly
                            engaged with the enemy all the morning. There was
                            considerable skirmishing all that evening. The next
                            morning <name type="person">Sherman</name> attempted
                            to flank Hardee's left when Cheatham met them,
                            holding them in check against considerable odds in
                            numbers. As we moved to Hardee's left we passed
                            Johnson's quarters in the smoky pines and all the
                            boys as they passed took of their hats and gave him
                            loud hearty cheers.</p>
                        <p>The fighting this morning all along the line was
                            quite heavy, and at different points on the line <note>

                        <p>In one of these attacks Gen Hardee lost a son. We
                            never fought under such circumstances before. The

                            Our men were almost worn out, having lost so much to
                            sleep; but being so used to the roar of musketry and
                            artillery, on the fields of <name type="place"

                            burst some times almost over them. The music of
                            battle seemed to lull to sleep. The Confederate
                            soldier was generous ever to his foes, and when they
                            were in our hands were ready to help in time of
                            trouble. On the battle field of <name type="place"
                                >Bentonville</name> the Federal line had been
                            repulsed and their dead and wounded were left on the
                            field, and as our men moved over the field, a
                            Confederate had a canteed partly filled with
                            whiskey, and having passed a Federal lying on the
                            field, with a leg nearly torn off by a shell,
                            stopped and lifting the wounded soldier in blue up
                            with <note>

                            I say?) friend? and said, "Thank God, Johnnie it may
                            come around some day that I can help you and I shall
                            never forget this drink of whiskey."</p>

                        <p>We left Smithfield April the 10th and on our march we
                            passed through Raleigh, Chappel Hill. There had
                            fallen and were still falling a great deal of rain,
                            and all the streams were full, and there being no
                            bridges we had to wade and swim all of them. When we
                            came to Cape fear river it was much swollen and was
                            rising. There was no way of crossing but to swim.
                            The men tried to form the muskey's chain by holding
                            each other's hand , but the current was to strong
                            and broke their hold. When my time came to try the
                            water, we gave our watch to Col Heiskell to keep it
                            out of the water, as it was up under my arms and
                            swift. We went in and halted, debated in our mind
                            whether to go on or return. Just then Gen Cheatham
                            came riding in and as he passed us, we caught hold
                            of his horse's tail and landed safely on the other
                            side. Finally all were over, and midnight found us
                            standing around our camp fires drying our
                            selves.</p>
                        <p>The next day we moved out and camped with\in 13 miles
                            of Greensborough, with <name type="person"
                                >Sherman</name> hovering close around us.</p>
                        <p>On the 18th we received the news of Lee's surrender
                            to Grant. Also we were told an Armistis of five days
                            had been agreed upon between <choice>

                            prepared for a surrender.</p>

                            Salisbury. On our way we passed through Thomasville
                            and the Ladies (God bless them) waved the
                            Confederate flag from the windows of the academy,
                            but they received only a faint responce.</p>
                        <p>We felt sad. We were put part of the funeral
                            procession going gome from the burial of the dead
                            Confederacy.</p>
                        <p>At Salisbury the Army disentegrated. After drawing of
                            rations and transportation had been provided, the
                            soldiers separated, the greater part of them going
                            South. All the Tennesseeans went north by way of
                            Ashville. When the Tennesseeans had passed out
                            beyond Salisbury they halted and formed line as in
                            review. Then Gen Cheatham came down the line shaking
                            the hand of every soldier, not one missed, while the
                            great big tears rolled down his cheeks. There was
                            not one whose eyes were not suffused with tears,
                            they were fountains of tears. As the generous and
                            brave General, whom we all loved shook our hands,
                            just now and then could he get out the word good by.
                            The great upheaval of his loving sympathetic heart
                            choked him as he walked down his line for the last
                            review of his faithful men. These tears told plainly
                            the depth of feeling in his great big heart for "His
                            boys" he loved and whom he led in many a hard fought
                            battle. Will any one who was present ever forget it?
                            No, never.</p>
                        <p>While there were a good many who left us on our way
                            through the Carolinas, and others who were
                            furloughed who were at <name type="place"

                            we Tennesseans picked ourselves up left Salisbury
                            and all the exciting and smokey battle scenes of
                            North Carolina behind and started out <lb/>On our
                            journey home.</p>
                        <p>On the ninth we passed through Morganton, late in the
                            evening and bivouaced for the night two miles
                            beyond. The next morning we moved out for Ashville
                            through which we passed on the 13th and camped a
                            short distance below on the French broad river for
                            the night. We reached Greenville Tenn <date
                                when="1865-05-15">May the 15th</date> where we
                            remained a few days. The nearer home we got now, the
                            more anxious the boys seemed to be there.</p>
                        <p>While at Greenville the boys were restless, and
                            seemed lost, we were waiting for transportation.
                            Here was an other separation of the boys. A part
                            took the East bound train for Bristol and
                            intermediate points, while the greater number
                            continued westward, dropping off here and there on
                            the way as they reached their respective homes. We
                            reached our home on the 18th of May.</p>

                        <p>My home was on Roseberry Creek near the rail road,
                            spanning the creek was a high bridge. The next
                            morning we repaired to the railroad to see some of
                            the men go by, who were waiting for trains when we
                            left Greenville. The train was just half way over
                            the <choice>

                            threw three cars full of soldiers down an embankment
                            thirty feet. Twelve Confederates were killed out
                            right, an several badly hurt.</p>
                        <p>To day twelve Confederate soliders ended their

                            the banks of Roseberry Creek at my old home. Sad,
                            and from a human stand point, hard, that these young
                            a noble brave boys, who had gone through the war,
                            should, just as they were about the "Step Stone" of
                            the dearest spot on earth to them, go down in this
                            horrible wreck.</p>
                        <p>Yes, the war is over. And through those long eventful
                            four years of dangers, hard ships and exposures, the
                            "Old 19th Tenn" bravely fought her way, bore her
                            part in the joys and sorrows of camp life, and
                            although but a few were left, she came out of the
                            struggle as true and as noble a regiment as <del
