            <p>Sir</p>
            <p>We wrote you in Original and Duplicate under the 28th, tttto, which we doubt not you have received.   Since then and on the 14th
				       Inst. part of the Cargo of the Ship Columbian Packed was Sold as Vendue,  by Order of the Court of N. Admiralty say all the Brandy, 
				       Fruit, Pickles, Almonds and Some of the Wine _ the Brandy 5/5 a Cas. pGal. Fruit $7 pCase, the other Articles we cannot Speak 
				       particularly of more than, that a small shipment of Wine in Cases sold at about $6. pdoz. there was a few Shots Claret bid off at about
				       $14 pShot, these not appearing a disposition to bid more for it, the Marshall Stoped the Sale.  the other Articles of the Cargo rests as
				       when Captn. Warrington left this, and it is likely that such part of the Cargo as is not likely to injure by lying, will remain as if a final
				       Decree is given, when that will be, is quite uncertain, as we presume the Captors have an expectation/or pretended so/ of producing
				       some proofs favorable to them that were taken in Some of the vessels from Bordeaux, and carryed to Halifax</p>
