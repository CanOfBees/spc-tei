               <note type="abstract">1863 April 26 Southgate Cregmile in Murfreesboro, Tenn., to his brother Crittenden. Updates him on the status of several of the hometown boys and notes that one was discharged while he was on picket. Scouting expeditions are resulting in many captured Rebel soldiers (butternuts), joining the already high number of deserters coming in. Having requested that the Union weekly newspaper be sent to his family, wants Crittenden to write him when they begin receiving it.</note>
