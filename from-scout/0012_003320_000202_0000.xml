            <p>Monday, January 1, 1866.</p>
            <p>I am now writting my Journal in a new book I found on
					my table this morning, it is a great deal smaller than the
					book I have been writting my Journal of 1865 in, but it is a
					perfect beauty, it has got an Almanac in the front of it.</p>
            <p>This morning I got up in good time, but I did not get through reciting my lessons till late, and I had to wait for Mrs. Wicks when I took my music lesson, so I did not get through till late, I am going to get through tomorrow, no matter what it cost; Mother was just the other way[.] she got through her washing in good time, but she could not dry her clothes as it rained.</p>
            <p>Ich war heute garnicht fleBig. [I was not industrious at all today].</p>

            <p>Tuesday, January 2, 1866.</p>
            <p>Today I got through my lessons in good time, yesterday I told you I was going to get through early and I did, I wish I could say that every day. Yesterday when I took my music lesson I left my piece that I was taking up there, so today when I watered Grant I went up there and got it, Father was up there at the time, Mrs. Cooper is feeling quite uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>Today Dr. Fouchee came to see father, he has just got back. This morning I got up at a quarter past three, but I went back to bed again.</p>
            <p>Herman Schenck brought my book back, he said he read it through. May be that Mr. Sanford will be elected Mayor of the town. Meine Mutter war heute zufrieden mit mir. [Today mother was very satisfied with me.]</p>

            <p>This morning Mother got up early and got the clothes hung out and the porch washed before breakfast, I was the other way [.] I got up late, and did not get through till late. I am going to get through earlier tomorrow. This morning Mrs. Wicks came and gave Mother her music lesson, Mrs. Herald went off with Mrs. Wicks and has not got back yet. today as it is so muddy I did not water the horse away from home. Last Monday Marie got a letter from her sister in Europe. Today I sent Herman Schenck&apos;s money to Ill. for the &quot;Little Corporal,&quot; I wrote a note last night, but Father told me what to say, Yesterday Mr. Wit came after Mrs. Sneed&apos;s Bible and Prayer book. Ich machte heute meine Aufgaben nicht gut. [Today I didn&apos;t do my assignments at all].</p>

Every evening now Marie goes upstairs to see Mrs. Herald, Marie says that she will be sorry  when Mr. H. comes back. Today Mr. Sanford started for New York, by way of Richmond. I would have liked to have gone with him, so as to see the battle fields.</p>

            <p>Today I got through my lessons very late, although I knew my lessons pretty well, except my spelling, but the trouble was this; I got up late, did not begin until late, was long reading and doing everything else, just as sure as I am living (I expect taht Mother thinks I am dead sometimes because I do not get thnrough till so very late) I am going to get through Monday. Today Mr. Armstrong sent father another load of corn.</p>
            <p>Mother dictates my German to me now, she says something about my lessons, she is going to see how many times I get my lessons good in a year.</p>

				   any body else ; they had a little post office, the folks would write letters to one another and not sign their names. Mrs. Bointen was post Mistress, but she told me that she
				   was so tired of it that if I would stay there and every dollar I got out of the people she would give me 10 centes. I got 20 cts.</p>

            <p>Today I knew my lessons perfectly and got through early.</p>
            <p>Yesterday evening I worked a long time on my wagon, it will take a good many evenings to finish it. I am going to ocqupy all of my spare time on it till I get it done.</p>
            <p>This noon I took a bag of corn down to the mill when, I watered Grant, I cannot get it till tomorrow. I had a good ride.</p>
            <p>Yesterday evening I asked Father if there was not something to put on the horses tails to keep them from dirtying up the stable. Mother said put on a diaper like babys.</p>

            <p>To day I have been feeling a great deal better, in fact I could not see that any thing was ailing with me at all.</p>
            <p>To day I knew my verses pretty good , I wish I could say that every Sunday.</p>
            <p>Mother and I went to church, there were not a great many there , I suppose it was on account of old Mr. House&apos;s funeral, Father had to go as he is a &apos;free mason&apos;, There
				   were, a  great many stranger&apos;s, I expect I thought so, because, there were not a great many ; so I could see better.</p>
            <p>Yesterday Mother bought some splendid June apples, but I was not allowed to eat any, on account of my stomack.</p>

				   the heat, I never had any shirts that I liked so much.</p>
            <p>Father bought a keg of beer, I think it is the awfulest tasting stuff , I ever tasted, Mrs. Heald says that if she wanted to vomit , she would taha that.</p>

            <p>It has been an incessantly hot day. Yesterday evening went to Sunday school , there were not a great many there, guess it was on account of it being so warm, when it was
				   out took care of my horses ate my supper, after that I watered them , then read in Sam Morrow Young folks, Father has subscribed for me now, got one volumn yesterday , it
				   is a magazine, like it very much.</p>
            <p>Did not get through till very late, will try and do better to-morrow. Took a music lesson this evening, I had to wait a good while on account of Matha Rogan , I beleive
				   she is a new scholar, from the way she played.</p>

            <p>It rained a good part of the day again to day.</p>
            <p>Have been sick again all day, and have taken quinine twice and have to take twice again, I tell you , it is worse than studying, had rather do two days work in one
				   day, than to have a day like to day , have not been down at all today, Mother staied up here a good while and sewed , read some little, but not much on account of
				   my head - ache ; I seem to want every thing that I cannot have , for instance ; ice cream, coconut, and chicken, do not know much to say as I have been so under the
				   weather, hope I will feel better tomorrow, you must exense suck writhing, as I did it in bed.</p>

            <p>It has been a very pleasant day to folks that are well , but not to the sick one&apos;s , and I unfortuneately happen to be among them . Have been sick now three days ,
				   have not been feeling much better.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Eugster is sick too, Mother is going to let her stay here till she is well, or better, I don&apos;t know witch.  This morning Mrs. Wicks came to give Mother a
				   music lesson, she came up and saw me.</p>
            <p>Today I just have to take quinine again.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Baenziger and Johnnie were here, such a noise he makes , Mrs. B. says he does not know what sick means, when she tells him &quot;to be still , that I am sick.&quot;</p>

            <p>It has been another pleas-ant day. To day I have been a great deal better, Mother says I look more natural , and I tell you I feel more natural, am right deaf on account
				   of having taken so much quinine .</p>
            <p>Mrs. Baenziger annd Johnnie were here again , it is that Mrs. B. is staying at Johanna&apos;s that she can come here so often , Johnnie looked at some pictures he liked
				   them , I love to hear him talk . Do not think Mrs. Eugster is much better.</p>
            <p>Went down and staied in the parlor while Mother practiced , did not stay up long.</p>
            <p>I will have to get &quot;good&quot; strong and well, before the 13th Sep. for the college is going to open then and I am going.</p>

            <p>It has been a pleasant day. Last night Father did not get back, so Mother had to &quot;sleep alone&quot;again&quot;, he did not get back till after I had gone to
				   school.</p>

				   Mr. Payne</p>
            <p>Father brought Billy home today the same way he did Grant , very dirty , so it took all of my leasure time to clean him.  The very next time I &quot;get time&quot;
				   I am going after our wheelbarrow it is done at last.</p>

            <p>To day I went to school for the first time since I have had the chills , I like it very well, the boys keep asking where I have been all of the time, those that stay
				   in the chapel say have you got a room now?, Mr. Payne told me I had to go in the lowest latin class and the next two, but Mr. Allen told me that perhaps it would take
				   all of the session for the small boys to catch up where we were when I got sick , and it would be better for me to study hard and catch up than to go into the lowest class.</p>
            <p>Father got me a pair of boots , I wore them to school they hurt my feet.</p>
